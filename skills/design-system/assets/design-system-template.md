# Design system: {product}

- Owner: design-system
- Status: draft
- Date: {YYYY-MM-DD, from `date +%F`}
- Flows: docs/design/flows.md
- Lint: {ok (YYYY-MM-DD) | failed | not run}

## Summary

{two sentences: what governs the values, how many tokens and components}

## Sources

- {library token file, brand artifact, decision id, user answer date}

## Ownership

- {group}: {library name and file | this document}. {rule}

## Colour

| Token | Light | Dark | Role | Source |
|-------|-------|------|------|--------|
| `{--prefix-name, the library's own property name}` | {#RRGGBB} | {#RRGGBB or same} | {role} | {library file and section, brand artifact, or user answer date} |

## Contrast

Ratios come from `contrast.py`, never from memory; the lint recomputes them from the Colour table.

| Text token | On background | Light ratio | Dark ratio | AA |
|------------|---------------|-------------|------------|----|
| `{text token}` | `{background token}` | {n.nn}:1 | {n.nn}:1 | {pass or fail} (needs {4.5 or 3}:1); used on {SCREEN-n region} |

## Type

- Typeface: {family}, fallback {stack}. Source: {brand artifact | user answer date} | Unknown, ask the user (OPEN-n). Recommended: {answer and why}
- Reading width: {value}. Source: {…}

| Role | Size | Line height | Weight | Source |
|------|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| {display, h1, h2, h3, body, small, code} | {px or rem} | {ratio} | {number} | {library base and stated ratio | brand artifact | user answer date} |

## Space, radii, borders, elevation

| Token | Value | Role | Source |
|-------|-------|------|--------|

## Layout

| Token | Value | Role | Source |
|-------|-------|------|--------|

## Components

| Component | Owner | Variants | States | Screens | Source |
|-----------|-------|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| {name} | {library or site} | {axes and values} | {default, hover, focus-visible, …} | {SCREEN-n, SCREEN-m: the ids from the flows} | {library file and section | flows SCREEN-n region} |
