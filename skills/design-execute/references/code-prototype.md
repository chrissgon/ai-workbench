# Code prototype runs

The automatic mode that is always available: the agent writes the artifact as HTML and CSS with the product's real stylesheet and renders it in a browser.

1. One folder per run: `docs/design/results/<artifact>/round-<n>/<direction>/`. Write `index.html` there (one file per frame when the deliverable has several, for example `landing-card.html`, `docs-card.html`).
2. Link the product's real assets the way the brief's non-negotiables say (a pinned CDN stylesheet, the fonts, the logo as inline SVG). Never re-implement a component the product ships.
3. Build the direction as the brief describes it, one direction per folder; do not blend ideas across folders.
4. Render every frame at the sizes of the brief's Deliverables:
   `node scripts/screenshot.mjs --html <file.html> --out <file.png> --width <w> --height <h> [--full-page] [--scale 2] [--dark] [--reduced-motion] [--wait <ms>]`
   Run it as written; nothing needs to be installed and nothing needs the user's approval. The script renders with a browser already on the machine, through that browser's headless command line: the one in `--browser <path>`, else in the `CHROME_BIN` environment variable, else `chromium`, `chromium-browser` or `google-chrome` on `PATH`, else the usual macOS application path. It uses the `playwright` package instead only when that package is already resolvable from the working directory or `NODE_PATH`. It prints the engine it used on stderr and `{"ok": true, …}` on stdout. A missing `playwright` package is not an error and not a reason to stop or to ask: do not offer to install it. Installing it is an option the user may choose on their own; the script never installs anything.
   When the browser reports that it has no usable sandbox (a container, a root user), the script retries once with `--no-sandbox` and says so on stderr; that is expected there, so carry on and repeat the warning in the report. It renders the local HTML file you wrote and whatever that file links, so render only the run's own pages.
   Only when the script exits with `no engine` (no package and no browser anywhere) is there nothing to render with: keep the HTML, leave the run's status `planned`, tell the user the two ways out the message names (the path of a browser, or installing the package themselves) and stop.
   `--out` must be a `.png` inside the working directory. Use `--wait` for animations to reach their final state, or `--reduced-motion` to capture it directly.
5. Look at every PNG before judging it; fix defects of the build (overflow, a font that did not load, a clipped text) in the same run, because they are not properties of the direction.
6. Record the outputs in the results document: the HTML path and the PNG path per frame.

Gotchas:

- Fonts load asynchronously; the script gives the page time to load them, but a font blocked by the network renders in the fallback: check the PNG, not the HTML.
- Text measured for a template (longest title, longest description) must be rendered with those longest values, not with the shortest example.
