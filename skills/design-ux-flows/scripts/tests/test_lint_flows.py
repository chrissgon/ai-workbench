- F-1: Receipt list. Outcome: the member sees every receipt. Priority: must. Phase: P-1. Source: brief
- F-2: Weekly digest. Outcome: the member gets a digest email every Monday. Priority: must. Phase: P-1. Source: brief
- F-3: Shared folders. Outcome: two members share receipts. Priority: later. Phase: P-2. Source: brief

## Summary

Two nodes, two screens and two flows.

## Sources

- docs/product/prd.md

## Information architecture

- IA-1: Receipts. Parent: none. URL: /receipts. Filled by: generated. Source: F-1

## Screens

- SCREEN-1: Receipt list. Purpose: show every receipt. Regions: list, filter. States: {list_states}. Breakpoints: one column when narrow. Source: F-1
- SCREEN-2: Digest email. Purpose: summarise the week. Regions: total, receipts,
  link to the list. States: {mail_states}. Breakpoints: single column. Source: F-2

## Flows

- FLOW-1: See receipts. Actor: U-1. Trigger: opens the app. Steps: 1. on SCREEN-1: opens the list → sees receipts. End: the list is shown. Failures: step 1: the error state. Keyboard: Tab to the list. Source: F-1
- FLOW-2: Read the digest. Actor: U-1. Trigger: Monday. Steps: 1. on SCREEN-2: opens the email → follows the link; 2. on SCREEN-1: sees the list. End: the list is shown. Failures: step 1: the email is not delivered. Keyboard: Enter on the link. Source: F-2

## Coverage

- F-1: FLOW-1, SCREEN-1
- F-2: FLOW-2, SCREEN-2

## Assumptions

- ASSUMPTION-1: One member per account. Safe because: the PRD names one user group.

## Open questions

- OPEN-1: Where does the filter sit? Blocks: nothing. Recommended: above the list, because it is the second region.

## Readiness

- Ready for design-system and design-brief: yes: SCREEN-1 first, because both flows cross it
