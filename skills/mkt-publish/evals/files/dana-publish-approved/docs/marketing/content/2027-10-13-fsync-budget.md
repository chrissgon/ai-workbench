## Post

```post
Durability is a budget. Priya Raman made that painfully clear at the Rust meetup.

In her demo, fsync on every write gave about 1,100 writes/s. Batching fsync every 10 ms gave about 41,000, same laptop.

Decide how much durability each write actually needs, then spend it on purpose.

How often does your database really fsync?
