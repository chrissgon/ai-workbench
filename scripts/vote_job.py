"""Publish the weekly vote post at its slot time, then record it in the profile repository's vote files.

Usage (built by scripts/runtime.py after the person's approval, run by the scheduler, never by hand):
  python3 vote_job.py --key <key> --round YYYY-MM-DD --date YYYY-MM-DD --lang EN --title "<topic>" \
      --repo <owner>/<name> --branch <branch> --platform <platform> --platform-file <platform>.json \
      --post-file post.txt [--comment-file comment.txt] [--image post.png --image-path assets/posts/<key>.png] \
      --publisher <publisher script> --resolver <secret resolver> --vcs <vcs provider script> \
      --vote-update vote_update.py --vote-state vote_state.py --work <folder> [--path <folder>]... \
      [--ledger <the publisher's idempotency ledger>]

The scheduler starts it with the system interpreter (/usr/bin/python3) and a short PATH; each --path folder
(runtime.json's "path") goes first on PATH, so that uv resolves where the person installed it.

Steps, each only when the one before it succeeded:
  1. publish the post (with its first comment and image) with the publisher and the idempotency key <key>. The
     step succeeded when the publisher printed the post's address (post_url): a post that went out while only
     its first comment failed is recorded like any other, and the comment's error is reported at the end;
  2. read data/pick.json, data/pick-queue.json and data/posts.json from the repository (read only), as they
     are now: the profile's own workflow may have committed since the approval;
  3. compute the recorded files with vote_update.py --record-post (post_url on the round, the post in
     posts.json), passing --platform and --platform-file, so that the address is checked against the shape the
     platform's data file gives; nothing else changes. A job without --platform-file (scheduled before the flag)
     calls vote_update.py in its old form, which checks only a generic https address and says so on stderr;
  4. commit them, and the image, with the vcs provider's commit-files, key <key>-record, only to
     data/pick.json, data/posts.json and assets/posts/*.

Every file argument is a verified copy in the scheduler's job folder (the scheduler swaps the paths), so
vote_update.py and vote_state.py sit in one folder and the import between them works. The person approved
all of it at once (scripts/runtime.py approve); a failure after the post went out leaves the post published
and prints what to record by hand.

Prints JSON on stdout, diagnostics on stderr. Exit 0 all done, 1 a step failed (the first comment included),
2 usage error. "published" and "recorded" in the JSON say how far it got.
Standard library only; the providers run through uv.
