"""The dependency map between the layers: every arrow of the layer diagram in
docs/architecture/platform/README.md is a row of ALLOWED below, and a Python file that reaches a file it may not is
a failing test.

What the scan reads: every .py file under skills/*/scripts/, shared/, providers/, contracts/, agents/, templates/,
packs/, scripts/, evals/, adapters/ and runtime/ (test folders excluded: they may reach anything). What it
collects, as repository-relative targets, only code (.py and .sh); reading a data file is not a dependency here:
  - an import (a sibling module, a dotted repository path, or a module whose file name is found in the repository);
  - a string that is wholly a path to a script ("providers/resolve.py");
  - os.path.join(...) or a `/` chain of Path objects whose literal parts name a script, a variable part read as a
    wildcard; a chain that ends in a variable inside a scripts/ folder is the target `<top>/.../scripts/*`.
A subprocess argument list is covered by the strings it holds. A file named only inside prose (a docstring, an
error message, a usage text) is not a string that is wholly a path and is not collected.

What the scan cannot see: a path built from variables only, a module loaded by a name read from a data file, and
the targets that a provider resolution returns at run time (providers/resolve.py exists so that those are not
paths in code). A new way of reaching a file is added to `scan` with its own case in the self-test below.

ALLOWED is the rules of the layer diagram. TOLERATED is every edge the code has today that ALLOWED refuses, each
named after the finding of docs/architecture/platform/review-2026-10-06.md that removes it (or that names the
rule it breaks), so that the list only shrinks: the test fails on an edge that is neither allowed nor tolerated,
and on a tolerated row the scan no longer finds. NOT_A_DEPENDENCY lists the paths the scan finds that are not a
dependency (a path read as text, a name in a table), each with the reason, held to the same staleness rule.
