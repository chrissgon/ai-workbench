GOOD_ROUND = """## Clarify: dark mode, round 1

### Facts established without asking
- The site is built with a static generator (source: package.json)

### Contradictions
- none

### Questions
**Q1. Should the toggle have two states or three?**
- Options: light/dark; light/dark/system
- Recommended: three states, with system as the default
- Why: "respect the OS by default" only survives a click when system is a stored choice.

**Q2. Are code blocks in scope for the first release?**
- Recommended: yes
- Why: unthemed code blocks are the most visible gap on a docs page.

### Next
Nothing is written yet.

- Owner: core-clarify
- Status: draft
- Date: 2026-03-02

## Goal
Every widget page documents the new version for application developers.

## Scope
- In: the 6 widget pages
- Out: the changelog page

## Constraints
- Release on 2026-04-01 (source: user)

## Decisions
| # | Decision | Chosen | Why | By |
|---|----------|--------|-----|----|
| 1 | Pages in scope | the 6 widget pages | they describe the changed API | user |
| 2 | Old docs | stay online | recorded earlier | user (recorded in docs/workbench/state.md) |

## Facts established without asking
- `WxDialog` is renamed to `WxModal` (source: MIGRATION.md)

## Open questions
- [ ] Who reviews the pages? (blocks: publication; recommended: the library maintainer, not adopted)

## Contradictions surfaced
- none
