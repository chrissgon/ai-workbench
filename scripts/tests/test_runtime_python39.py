"""The scheduled tick runs scripts/runtime.py with /usr/bin/python3 (Python 3.9 on macOS), and the runtime starts
the scripts below with that same interpreter (providers/CONTRACT.md, "Python version"). Three guards:

1. Syntax: each file parses as Python 3.9, and a `X | None` annotation, which 3.9 evaluates at definition time and
   refuses, is either absent or deferred with `from __future__ import annotations`.
2. Header: a script with an inline-metadata header declares a `requires-python` that admits 3.9, so the header
   never claims a newer interpreter than the one the scheduler starts it with.
3. Execution: each file is imported by the interpreter running this test. CI runs this file, and the tests of the
   scripts on this path, on Python 3.9 (.github/workflows/checks.yml, job python39), where the import is the real check.

Providers that reach the network run through `uv run` under their own `requires-python` and are not listed.
A new script the runtime or a scheduler starts with the system interpreter is added to ON_SYSTEM_PYTHON."""
