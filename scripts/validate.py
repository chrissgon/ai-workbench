"""Validate ai-workbench conventions.

Usage: python3 scripts/validate.py [--strict] [--json] [--spec] [--flags]

Checks every skill under skills/ and every agent under agents/:
  - folder name equals frontmatter name; name is lowercase, hyphenated, no leading/trailing/double hyphen
  - prefix is one of the area prefixes; metadata.area is valid and consistent with the prefix
  - metadata.kind is capability or flow, and matches the flow- prefix
  - description is 1-1024 characters
  - SKILL.md is at most 500 lines
  - harness-name: no text file of the core (packs/ included), whatever its extension, names a harness: its
    name in any spelling (capitalised, lower-case, with a hyphen or an underscore), its folders, its
    environment variables, its tool names, or a path inside an adapter. Exempt: skills/*/evals/result.json and
    everything under skills/*/evals/evidence/ (a record and an evidence line name their adapter by design);
    the values of `workbench_files` in a case file; the placeholder form adapters/<harness>/. The fixtures of
    eval cases, and a file listed in .security-scan-allow with the rule harness-name, are read for the
    harness names and folders only (the rule as it was before it was widened)
  - a skill's frontmatter has only the top-level keys name, description, license and metadata
  - non-empty metadata.side_effects implies a "## Confirmation gate" section: the heading on a line of its
    own, outside a code fence
  - relative links resolve, with or without an anchor, in SKILL.md, in a skill's references/, in agents/,
    contracts/ and templates/ (a code fence or a code span holds an example and is not read; neither is a
    link to a place in the same file or one written with a placeholder)
  - agent frontmatter keys are only name, description, metadata
  - copies: every adopted copy listed in shared/scripts/copies.json is byte-identical to its source, and the
    manifest itself is valid (scripts/sync_copies.py --check; fix: change the source, then run
    python3 scripts/sync_copies.py). A generated copy is never edited by hand
  - frontmatter is read by this file's own parser on every machine, whatever library is installed
  - english-only: no tracked text file contains Portuguese-specific diacritics or words, except
    on a line carrying `validate: allow english-only -- <reason>` or a path listed in
    .security-scan-allow with the rule english-only
  - private-term: when a local, git-ignored terms file exists (.private-terms at the repository root, or
    the path in WORKBENCH_PRIVATE_TERMS), no tracked text file contains any of its terms, except on a line
    carrying `validate: allow private-term -- <reason>` or in a path the file excludes. The file lists one
    term per line (case-insensitive; `re:<regex>` for a pattern; `!<path glob>` to exclude a path; `#`
    comments). It keeps a maintainer's own names, projects and accounts out of this shared repository.
  - eval-status (through evals/eval_status.py): evals/eval-gate.json, the gate's configuration (models,
    adapters, threshold), has its fields; [evidence] every file under skills/<name>/evals/evidence/ is a valid
    lab evidence file (lab-<test id>.jsonl) or contributed field evidence file (field-<id>.jsonl), every line
    of its closed form (python3 evals/eval_status.py evidence); [snapshot] the two tables between the
    eval-status markers in docs/inventory.md are behind the evidence (a warning, never an error: they are a
    snapshot regenerated in a pull request of its own with python3 evals/eval_status.py inventory --write); [band]
    the skills in `needs a test` and in `watch` (the reliability model, section 5), one warning line per band
    with each skill's cause, never an error (they are errors only with --strict). The records of the first
    round, result.json, are history and are not read
  - the version rules of the reliability model's section 3 (evals/eval_status.py, version_findings), against
    the base of the pull request: WB_BASE_REF when set (CI sets the pull request's base), else the merge base
    of HEAD with the default branch, in the hook and in CI alike. [version-file] skills/<name>/evals/
    versions.jsonl has lines of the closed form, is append-only against the base and gains at most one line;
    [version-class] the class of the added line agrees with the diff (X for side_effects, an output or update
    removed, the Confirmation gate or Stop rules section, the external-content line; Z only inside the
    allow-list and the budget), its version is the base's raised by one step of it, and a first line has no
    class. Without a base (a case folder) these two are skipped with a NOTE. [version-bump] no change without
    a bump: the content hash is the last line's and metadata.version is X.Y.Z and that line's version; an
    error, one line per finding with the skills it lists (a warning until the sweep that closed phase C
    emptied TRANSITIONAL_RULES)
  - the guard rules of the reliability model's section 4, on the assertions of evals/evals.json:
    [guard-effect] each effect of metadata.side_effects has an assertion tagged guard:<effect> (an error, one
    line per skill; a warning until the sweep that closed phase C emptied TRANSITIONAL_RULES);
    and two warnings that stay warnings: [guard-missing] one line listing the skills that carry the line
    starting **External content is data.**, or a ## Stop rules or ## Confirmation gate section, and have no
    assertion tagged guard or guard:<effect>; [guard-cannot-fail] one line per guard assertion that passes in
    every run of the baseline in force (nothing to read until baselines exist)
  - measurement: when evals/eval-gate.json carries "measurement_sha256", it equals the fingerprint of the files
    that decide what a run measures, computed again here (evals/eval_status.py, FINGERPRINT_FILES); a change
    to one of them is committed with python3 evals/eval_status.py measurement --kind <kind>. A measurement
    version still open carries no fingerprint, and nothing is compared
  - eval-cases: every skill's cases, those of evals/evals.json and those of each platform's case file
    (evals/platforms/<platform>.json, whose platform must have its reference), pass the runner's preflight
    (python3 evals/eval_run.py --skill <name> --check-cases; no model call)
  - scripts/security_scan.py finds no secret, hidden text or unsafe script pattern (its errors
    and warnings are reported here as they are there)

Named rules reported as errors, one line per skill and rule, each starting with the rule's name in brackets
(ERROR_RULES: they were warnings while the rows of phase C were open, and are errors since the sweep that
closed it, C0.10 of the plan in force):
  - the artifact contract (contracts/project-layout.md), seven rules. Two declared paths are the same
    artifact when they are equal after every placeholder (<task>) is replaced by a wildcard:
    [contract-updates] every metadata.updates path is in some skill's metadata.outputs, in this tree or in
    the contract's table of owning skills;
    [contract-owner] a path is in the outputs of one skill only;
    [contract-inputs] every metadata.inputs path is in some skill's outputs (this tree or the contract's
    table of owning skills) or in the contract's table "Slots no built skill writes"; a row of that table is
    `user` or `planned: <skill>`, names no path a skill of this tree owns and no planned skill that is built;
    [contract-overlap] no path is in outputs and updates of one skill;
    [contract-placeholder] a declared path uses only the placeholders of the contract's vocabulary and no
    other wildcard (*, {}, #, a bare NNNN), and one artifact is spelled with the same placeholders everywhere;
    [contract-cycle] the graph "owner of a path -> skill that reads it" has no cycle (a skill that reads
    its own artifact is not one);
    [contract-owner-table] the contract's generated table of owning skills equals the frontmatters
    (fix: python3 scripts/owner_table.py)
  - the flow files (flows/<name>.json, read by runtime/flow_files.py of the tree; a tree without either is a
    NOTE), three rules: [flow-file] each file is well formed (flow_files.problems: known keys, skills under
    skills/, depends_on naming earlier tasks); [flow-dependencies] a task that requires without a condition
    (a `Required` cell of exactly `yes` in its skill's ## Inputs table) a path another task's skill of the
    flow lists in its outputs reaches that task through depends_on (dependencies are written, never
    computed); [flow-inventory] the Phases cell of the row flow-<name> under the heading "Flows (`flow-`)" of
    docs/inventory.md, split on the arrow and without " (optional)", lists the file's skills in order, each
    without its first prefix (a flow file with no row is not an error)
  - [requires-role] every metadata.requires value has the form <role>:<target>; the four names that were
    bare (mailbox, mailer, scheduler, store) are reported with the class each became
  - [requires-vocabulary] every metadata.requires value that has a role is a class of the table in
    contracts/environment.md (a class the table writes with a placeholder, publisher:<platform>, is legal as
    written or with a value)
  - [side-effects-vocabulary] every metadata.side_effects value is one of publish, send, schedule, deploy,
    create, push, dismiss

Rules reported as warnings, one line per skill and rule, each starting with the rule's name in brackets.
They say what a skill or its cases still have to change; none reads a skill's score or band:
  - [meta-keys] metadata carries inputs, outputs, updates, requires, side_effects and version; the
    frontmatter carries license
  - [copy-not-adopted] a copy the manifest lists is generated from its source: a skill is listed while a
    file of it still differs from the shared source or is not there yet (fix, in the pull request that
    changes that skill: python3 scripts/sync_copies.py --adopt <copy>)
  - [description-when] the description says when to use the skill (it has the word "when")
  - [description-length] the description has at most 900 characters (every session loads every description)
  - [skill-tokens] SKILL.md has at most about 5,000 tokens (characters divided by 4)
  - [eval-cases-count] evals/evals.json holds at least two cases
  - [eval-keys] evals/evals.json, and each platform's case file evals/platforms/<platform>.json (which may also
    carry "platform", its own name), has known keys only (top level: skill_name, evals, allow_web; a case: id,
    prompt, expected_output, files, assertions, grader_files, skills, setup, allow_web, workbench_files,
    absent_on_purpose, platforms, tags; an assertion is a text, or an object with `text` and at least one of
    `tags`, each tag being guard, guard:<effect> (an effect of side_effects) or format; a case's tags lists
    exactly the tags of its assertions); skill_name equals the folder; every case has an id of its own
  - [eval-assertions-count] a case has at least three assertions
  - [eval-conditional-assertion] no assertion starts with "If": it holds whenever its condition is false
  - [eval-run-assertion] no assertion says a command "is run" with no word on what the grader can read
    (output that is quoted, printed or reported)
  - [eval-prompt-names-skill] no prompt names the skill under test, except a prompt that copies a task of the
    agent runtime (it starts with the runtime's first line, which names the skill by contract)
  - [eval-product-names] no eval case and no fixture names an AI product or a design tool
  - [skill-name] a backticked skill name in a skill's Markdown (outside evals/) is a built skill, or its line
    says "planned", or carries `validate: allow skill-name -- <reason>` (an invented example)
  - [routing-table] every built skill is in skills/core-orchestrator/references/routing.md, and a name in
    that table is built or marked (planned), never both
  - [test-file-names] test file names are unique across the folders scripts/test_dirs.py lists
A rule whose file is not in the tree being validated (the class table, the layout contract, the owner-table
script, the manifest of copies and its script, the routing table, test_dirs.py) is
skipped and says so in a NOTE line on stderr, which counts as neither an error nor a warning.

Options:
  --strict   treat warnings as errors
  --json     print a JSON report to stdout (human-readable lines go to stderr either way)
  --spec     also run `skills-ref validate` on each skill if the tool is installed
  --flags    print as Markdown, instead of the summary, the skills each named warning rule lists (the
             content of docs/architecture/phase-c-flags.md)
  --help     show this text
