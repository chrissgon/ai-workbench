#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Install ai-workbench skills into the cross-tool skills directory.
#
# Usage: bash adapters/agents-dir/install.sh [--pack <name>] [--project <dir>] [--copy] [--dry-run] [--uninstall]
#
# Default target is ~/.agents/skills (read by Codex, Cursor, Cline, OpenCode, OpenClaw and others).
# --pack <name>    which skills to install (packs/<name>.txt); default: default
# --project <dir>  target <dir>/.agents/skills instead of the user-level directory
# --copy           copy folders instead of symlinking (for filesystems without symlinks)
# --uninstall      remove everything this installer made in the target, whatever pack installed it
# The shared references go beside the skills, in <target>/../shared/references, so that a skill's
# ../../shared/references/<file> resolves by the installed path. A pack that selects no skill is
# reported and changes nothing (exit 0). Installing a pack removes what an earlier pack installed
# and this one does not select, a dangling link to a renamed or removed skill included.
# Replaces or removes only what it made (its symlinks, or copies holding its marker file; the
# shared folder holds the marker in both modes); a folder of the same name that is not its own is
# skipped and reported, and the run exits 1. Exit 2 on a usage error.
