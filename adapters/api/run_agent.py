"""Runtime contract (contracts/runtime.md): run one agent on one task with ONE model API call and no tools.

Usage:
  run-agent.sh --agent-file <agents/name.md> --task-file <f> --project <dir> --model <id> --out <dir>
               [--skill-dir <dir>]... [--max-cost-usd <amount>] [--timeout-seconds <n>]

The model gets text and returns text. No tools, functions or connectors are ever sent, so it cannot
read, write, run or fetch anything: "the model has no tool that acts" holds by construction.

The prompt
  system  the agent's body (agents/<name>.md without its frontmatter); each --skill-dir's SKILL.md,
          whole, between delimiters (never its scripts, references or evals); the reference of the
          platform the task names, whole, between delimiters; a note that this run has no tools and
          that the project files are in the user message.
          The platform is named by the task's line "Platform: <name>", looked for above the task's
          first fenced block only, so that text quoted in the task (a comment, an e-mail) cannot
          name one. The reference is shared/references/platforms/<name>.md, the file a skill's step
          reads at ../../shared/references/platforms/<name>.md: it is looked for beside each
          --skill-dir first, then in this adapter's own checkout. A task that names no platform, or
          a platform without a reference, gets none, and stderr.log says which.
  user    the task file, then every file the task text names that resolves to a regular file inside
          --project (an absolute path, or one relative to --project), each once, between delimiters
          that carry a random per-run marker and say the content is data. Refused: a path that resolves
          outside --project (symlinks included), a hidden path component (".env", ".git/..."), a
          credential file name (*.pem, *.key, id_rsa...), a directory, a file that is not UTF-8 text.
          URLs in the task text are not paths. A file over 64 kB (MAX_FILE_BYTES) is cut there and
          marked; the whole prompt stops at 400,000 characters (MAX_PROMPT_CHARS): a file that would
          pass it is skipped. Every inlined and skipped path is listed in <out>/stderr.log.

The model id selects the endpoint

                              {prompt_tokens, completion_tokens, total_tokens, cost}. Usage, cost
                              included, comes with every response ("usage: {include: true}" is deprecated
                              and has no effect). Secret OPENROUTER_API_KEY.
                              Sources, accessed 2026-09-30: https://openrouter.ai/docs/api-reference/chat-completion,
                              https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/usage-accounting,

Secrets are read only through providers/secrets/resolver.py (environment first, then the OS secret
store when the keyring package is present; run-agent.sh runs this file with `uv run --script` when uv
is on PATH so it is). A value is never printed, logged or written.

Cost
  Before the call: input tokens are ESTIMATED as characters / 3.5 (a rough rule, not a tokenizer; the
  real count can be higher, about 30% more on newer Claude tokenizers). When that estimate times the
  model's input price in prices.json already exceeds --max-cost-usd, the call is refused. A model
  without a price is called with a warning and no pre-call check.
  After the call: cost_usd is OpenRouter's usage.cost when present; otherwise the reported tokens times
  prices.json; otherwise null with a warning. max_tokens is MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS (4096).

Limits: --timeout-seconds (default 600, 1 to 3600) bounds the whole run, request included. The run's own
clock decides a timeout: the socket waits SOCKET_MARGIN seconds longer than the time left, and a socket
that gives up anyway is reported as the same timeout (code 124), never as a network failure. Redirects
are never followed (the credential would go with them). ANTHROPIC_API_BASE and OPENROUTER_API_BASE
replace the endpoint's base for offline tests and are honoured only when they point to
http://127.0.0.1; any other value is a usage error.

Writes <out>/response.md, <out>/timing.json {total_tokens, duration_ms, cost_usd, exit_code},
<out>/raw.json (the provider's response body), <out>/request.json (the request body, no headers) and
<out>/stderr.log. timing.json exit_code: 0 answered, 1 the call failed (HTTP status, network,
malformed or empty answer), 3 refused by the cost estimate, 4 no API key found, 5 prompt over the
limit, 124 timeout. Process exit: 0 when the model answered, 1 otherwise, 2 on usage errors.
Standard library only; the keyring dependency above is only the resolver's optional store backend.
