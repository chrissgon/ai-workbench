"""The external effects of the task runtime: what a skill with a confirmation gate showed at its gate, recovered
from what the run left, and (stage 4, WP-4.8) its execution by code once the person approved its hash.

A skill with a confirmation gate runs up to the gate (limit L16). The pull-request skill writes its payload, exactly
as it shows it, to payload.md in a folder from mktemp -d and states that file's path and sha256 in its reply. The
run's temporary folder comes back inside the run folder (runtime/lab.py, tmp_in_run), and the payload is taken from
there only when it is the file the reply hashed: the reply's text is never taken in its place, and nothing here
picks "the most likely" file.

When the person approves the hash of the effect document (effect.json in the run folder, which binds the repository
and the base of the configuration, the head the runtime named, the title and the body the skill showed, and every
file of the change set by its hash), code checks that nothing moved since, makes the one commit through the code
provider (commit-files, with the person's own git and signature) and opens the pull request (open-pr). The runtime
passes the provider no credential: it reads its own. No module of runtime/ runs git commit or git push itself.

What belongs to one kind of effect (its payload form, its document, what the person reads, its checks and its
execution) is a module of runtime/ with a fixed set of names (runtime/effect_pull_request.py states them), chosen by
the side-effect word the skill's manifest names in its gate. This module holds what no kind changes: recovering the
payload, the error, the effect file and its hash, the call of a provider, the row of the state file, and the registry.
A new kind is a module and a row of KINDS; runtime/ops.py does not change.

The registry has one key per kind, and the key is a word of the side-effect vocabulary (contracts/environment.md,
SIDE_EFFECTS of scripts/validate.py): the gate path reads the word a skill's manifest names in its gate, the policy
path reads the word of the effect document a handler hands to ops.execute_under_policy, and both find the same module.
What a kind module exposes, in two groups:

    for both paths     describe(doc)                     one line that says what is approved or done: the state file's
                                                         row and the action's record
                       PROVIDER_CLASS                    the class of provider that executes it (providers/resolve.py)
                       GATE                              True when a skill's gate may name the kind's word; a
                                                         registered kind that is not GATE is no kind there (a review)
    for the gate path  refusal, head, prepare, parse, mismatch, document, body, title, summary, unconfigured, verify,
                       execute                           the names runtime/effect_pull_request.py lists and ops.py calls
    for the policy     POLICY                            True when the kind may run under a standing approval
    path               policy_platform(doc)              the platform the provider is resolved with, or None
                       policy_effect(doc)                {"kind", "target", "files", "items"}: what autonomy.covers
                                                         checks; its target, the resolved one, is the one recorded
                       policy_argv(doc)                  the verb and the document's args, without the flags in
                                                         RESERVED_FLAGS: the operation adds --allow per bound glob,
                                                         --idempotency-key, then --dry-run or --confirmed

A kind of one path alone has only that path's names. EFFECT_KEYS and RESERVED_FLAGS are the common shape of a
document a handler hands over and the flags the operation adds and a handler never may.

Public names: recover_payload(reply, tmp_dir, readable), EffectError, KINDS, EFFECT_KEYS, RESERVED_FLAGS,
module_for(kind), policy_kinds(), write(run_dir, doc), read_document(effect_file, sha256), provider_call(provider,
args[, run]), approval_row(approval, doc).
