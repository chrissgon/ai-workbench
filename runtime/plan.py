"""The plan of a request: the tasks code builds from a route, which the person approves before any task exists.

The planning agent creates no task (limit L19): the router returns a route, or the person names a flow, and this
module turns it into the tasks of a plan, from the flow file (runtime/flow_files.py) or, for a route to one skill, a
plan of one task. The plan is shown to the person as a pending decision of kind `plan`; its tasks are created only
when the person approves it (runtime/ops.py, approve), and only the approved tasks, by their hash.

Functions:
  pack_skills(project_cfg, root)            the names of the skills in scope: the union of the packs of the enabled
                                            area agents of the project's configuration, else the pack `default`
  from_flow(flow, root, pack)               the tasks of a loaded flow file, as plan tasks
  from_skill(skill, title, root)            a plan of one task, with an empty text: its prompt is the plain request
  plan_hash(tasks)                          the sha256 of the tasks, the hash the person approves
  title_of(text, title=None)                the title of a request: the one given, else the first sentence of the
                                            text when it fits TITLE_CHARS, else the first line cut at a word
  request_title(row)                        the title shown for a request row of the store, whatever rule made its
                                            stored title (the plan's first line and the rows of `status` use it)
  scope_refusal(flow, outside, root)        the sentence of a flow whose skills no enabled area agent has
  build(request, tasks, route, source, limits, past, flow=None, deliveries=None, unrouted=None)
                                            the title, the body and the payload of the plan

Stage 6 (several deliveries, the brief, sub-tasks):
  split(text)                               {"preamble", "items"}: the lines of a request that start with "- " are its
                                            deliveries (fewer than two: one delivery, the whole text); at most
                                            MAX_DELIVERIES, each costs one run of the router
  resolve_pack(pack, root)                  the skills of one pack, by scripts/select_skills.py
  agent_skills(project_cfg, root)           {"<agent>": [skills of its pack]} for every enabled area agent
  agent_of(skill, agent_skills)             the one enabled agent other than planning whose pack holds the skill (the
                                            planning agent when only its pack does); none or several: ValueError
  owner_of(path, root)                      the skill whose declared outputs hold path, or None
  delivery_tasks(route, k, flows, root, pack, prefix)   the tasks of one routed delivery
  combine(request, routed, flows, agent_skills, root, *, pack, limits, past)   one plan from the routes of the
                                            deliveries, in the order listed: {"plan": build() or None, "tasks",
                                            "deliveries", "unrouted"}
  backlog_tasks(backlog_path, root=None)    the product backlog's `todo` tasks as proposed sub-tasks, each read by one
                                            run of the sub-task skill's script task.py (runtime/isolated.py: an
                                            isolated subprocess, never loaded into this process)
  subtasks(limits, existing_count, proposed, known=())   {"create", "ask"}: what the approved plan's limits cover

Derived waits (A-29: the runtime knows by itself which task waits for which, from the artifact contract):
  skill_facts(root)                         {skill: {"inputs", "outputs", "required"}} of every skill folder: the
                                            frontmatter lists, and the inputs whose row of the skill's inputs table says
                                            Required: yes
  owners_of(index, path)                    the skills whose declared outputs are path (placeholders read as wildcards)
  derive(nodes, facts, exists, ...)         {"waits", "missing", "cycles"}: for each task not yet started, the open task of
                                            another request that writes an input the project does not have yet; the
                                            required inputs nothing writes; the waits left out because they would wait
                                            in a circle. Pure: the project is read through the exists function it is given
  wait_lines(waits, missing, cycles, titles)   the lines a plan's body adds for them

A plan task is {"key", "skill", "title", "text", "depends_on": [keys], "milestone", "mandatory_milestone", "web"}:
milestone is true when the flow file says so or the skill's runtime manifest makes it a mandatory milestone; web is
whether the skill requires the web. No cost in money is written: the estimate counts runs.
