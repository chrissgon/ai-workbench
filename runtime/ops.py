"""The operations layer of the task runtime: every operation a person or a scheduler can perform, once.

The terminal shell (runtime/cli.py), the conversation (runtime/chat.py) and later the local interface are shells over the
functions of this file: a shell parses what the person typed, calls one function here and prints what it
returns. No shell reaches the store, the lab facade or a project's files by itself. What a shell may call, with which
arguments and from which channel, is the table of operations (runtime/operations.py, re-exported here as
ops.operations): a shell derives its verbs and commands from it, and a text of this file that names a command is built
by it, never written out.

Every operation takes the project folder first, reads the project's configuration
(<project>/docs/workbench/runtime.json, runtime/project_config.py), refuses to act when that file names
another workbench checkout than the one this code runs from, opens the store (class store:runtime, through
providers/resolve.py) and returns a JSON-serialisable object. An operation that changes the store does it
through one function of the store, which is one transaction.

Operations of stage 1 of the platform plan:
  request(project, text, flow)     record a request and the tasks of the named flow file
  run_next(project[, tier])        run the next ready task: one skill, once, in the eval container, on a copy
                                   of what may enter by limits L1 to L6 (runtime/workcopy.py); bring back what
                                   it left by the path rule; open the pending decision the task then waits on
  pending(project[, pending_id])   what waits for the person
  answer(project, pending_id, text)   answer a pending decision: the task runs again with the answer
  release(project, pending_id)     release a delivery: the task is done, and what depended on it becomes ready
  retry(project, task_id)          make a failed or blocked task ready again
  cancel(project, request_id)      cancel a request and what is still open under it
  status(project)                  requests, tasks, pending decisions
  proof(project[, skill])          the model each skill in use would run on, by its proof (runtime/proof.py); no
                                   model is called
  verdict(project, run_id, word)   record the person's verdict (worked, corrected, failed) on the use of a run,
                                   with the existing recorder (scripts/evidence.py)
  accept_config(project, sha256)   record the hash of docs/workbench/runtime.json the person accepts; every
                                   other operation refuses a configuration whose hash is not the accepted one

Operations of stage 3:
  request(project, text)           without a flow: a request that waits for its route
  route(project, request_id[, flow])   one run of the router skill asked only for the route (runtime/router.py),
                                   or, with flow, the flow the person names; either way code builds the plan
                                   (runtime/plan.py) as a pending decision of kind `plan`; no task is created
  approve(project, pending_id[, sha256])   approve a plan (its tasks are created) or an acceptance
  reject(project, pending_id[, note])      reject a plan or an acceptance: the request is cancelled
  sync(project[, dry_run][, take, path])   mirror the tasks with the project's task board (runtime/board.py) and
                                   the documents with its documents platform (runtime/documents.py): what a person
                                   edited there comes in, what the store and the project hold goes out; a dry run
                                   reads nothing and shows every write; take and path settle a document that was not
                                   taken
  answer(..., with_comments=True)  the comments saved from the board for the task, and from the platform for the
                                   documents its skill owns, enter the answer
  hand_over(project, task_id, file)   put a file of the person's in a task's file drop (runtime/drop.py): it enters
                                   that task's runs, and the prompt lists it

Operations of stage 4:
  deps(project)                    install the project's declared dependency sets by code, with no model
                                   (runtime/deps.py); a run whose copy holds versioned files gets each set that
                                   applies, after its base commit, and never brings it back

Operations of stage 6:
  progress(project[, since])       where the work stands and what happened in a period (runtime/progress.py),
                                   computed from the store's records; it calls no model
  approve_policy(project, file, agent[, sha256, expires, what])   a standing approval of a policy file, bound by
                                   its hash, with an expiry: without the hash a preview; with it, the approvals table
                                   gets the row (an earlier one of the same policy and agent is revoked) and the state
                                   file's ## Approvals its generated copy, the row the engagement gate reads
  revoke_policy(project, approval_id)   end a standing approval; its row leaves the state file
  standing(project, policy)        whether an active standing approval covers the policy now: a read
  execute_under_policy(project, policy, effect_file)   the one place a policy effect is executed: checks the effect
                                   document against the standing approval's bounds (autonomy.covers) holding the run
                                   lock, makes the provider's dry run and its confirmed call, records the action
  set_mode(project, agent, mode)   set one area agent's autonomy mode in runtime.json (runtime/autonomy.py, the five
                                   modes, in the order stopped < supervised < milestones < autonomous < autonomous-with-policy).
                                   A move down that order is accepted by code at once (`code:narrowing`); a move up
                                   is accepted by the person (accept_config). Either rewrites the state file's
                                   Checkpoints line, a generated copy of the most careful enabled agent's mode
  route(project, request_id)       a request whose lines starting with "- " list several deliveries gets one router
                                   run per delivery and one plan of them all, chained in the order listed
                                   (runtime/plan.py, combine); a route to the brief skill plans one brief task, and
                                   the delivery is routed again after the brief is released; every task names its
                                   area agent
  dispatch(project[, budget_seconds])   the dispatcher's round (runtime/dispatcher.py decides): the handlers' ticks,
                                   the releases each agent's mode makes, the runs its mode and caps allow, one at a time
  poll(project)                    the short job: mirrors, expired approvals, the state file's generated lines, the
                                   releases a mode makes; it calls no model and starts no task
  handler_call(project, name, verb[, args])   one verb of a handler under runtime/handlers/, its JSON object
  pin(project)                     the pin of the dispatcher's two jobs: the accepted runtime.json's path and hash
  say(project, text[, channel])    one turn of the conversation with the planning agent (runtime/chat.py is its shell):
                                   a command, the answer to the router's question, or a new request with the memory
  release(project, pending_id)     also starts what a release starts: the brief's delivery routed again (its tasks
                                   wait in an acceptance), and, when the released task returned the product backlog,
                                   its todo tasks as sub-tasks inside the approved plan's limits (the others wait in
                                   an acceptance)

Operations of stage 7:
  contained_run(project, skill, prompt, out_dir[, platforms, timeout])   one run of one skill of an area agent's
                                   pack, in the eval container, on the artifacts the skill declares and nothing else,
                                   for a caller that is not a task (a handler's agent run): nothing is brought back, only
                                   the reply, past the credential scan, in <out_dir>/response.md with <out_dir>/timing.json

Operations of stage 9 (the local service, runtime/service.py, is one more shell of this layer):
  config(project)                  the configuration's path and hash, whether the person accepted that hash, and the data
                                   folder: the one read that does not refuse a configuration that was not accepted
  task(project, task_id)           one task or request with its runs and its pending decisions of every status
  flows(project)                   the flow files of this checkout: name, title, number of tasks (or the error)
  stop_runs([project])             end the runs this process started, through the lab's own stop
  pending, status                  each pending decision carries "actions": the resolution words the store allows for it
                                   now, built from the store's tables (an open effect: approved and rejected)
  approve(..., channel)            an effect is approved from the terminal and from the local page, with its hash; any
                                   other channel, or none, is refused
  agents(project)                  each area agent: its configuration, the mode it acts in now, its use of today, the
                                   tasks queued for it and how many of them the last round held
  status(project)                  also "held": the ready tasks the last round did not start, each with its reason
                                   (runtime/dispatcher.py, REASONS), or "dispatch off" while the local service dispatches nothing
  service_check(project[, dispatch_every])   what the local service checks at its start (secret store, credential,
                                   docker, image, dispatch) and remembers for connections and status
  conversation(project[, conversation, after])   the messages of the project's conversation above an id, oldest first
  skills(project)                  the skills in scope with their version, area, whether they have a runtime manifest,
                                   their proof as runtime/proof.py gives it and their runs here, and the two checks
  costs(project[, since])          the runs by day, agent, model and adapter with the cost the store recorded and the
                                   cost recomputed from the token counts and model_prices (runtime/costs.py)
  connections(project)             which provider each requirement class of the skills in scope resolves to, which
                                   secrets are found and where (never a value), the eval image and the platform; no
                                   provider is started and nothing goes over the network; "service": what the local
                                   service found at its start, null in any other process
  artifacts(project), artifact(project, path)   the project's files under docs/ with their owner skill, and the text
                                   of one of them, read-only
  say                              refuses a turn that would route while another run of the project holds the run lock
                                   before it stores anything

Code comes back as a change set (runtime/changeset.py, limits L9 and L11): a run of a code task (its skill is of a
code area, code_task) whose copy holds versioned files starts only when the project's tracked files have no
uncommitted change, from the project's files plus the newest unblocked change set of its request; what it did to
versioned files is kept in its run folder as one change set, never written into the project. A document task makes
no change set and is not held to clean tracked files; a versioned file it changed is listed in `kept`. The pending decision lists the change set, and a review whose change set is blocked
is not released: it is answered, or the request is cancelled.

A task whose skill's runtime manifest names a gate (the pull-request skill) runs up to its confirmation gate: its
copy holds the request's change set as one commit on a branch over its base (the configuration's code.base), as the
skill was measured; its temporary folder comes back in its run folder; the payload it wrote there is recovered only
when it is the file its reply hashed (runtime/effects.py), and kept as <run folder>/payload.md. When it parsed,
agrees with the configuration and the change set is not blocked, the task waits on an `effect`: the effect document
(<run folder>/effect.json) and its hash. approve(project, pending_id, sha256) with that hash records the approval
(the store's approvals table), checks that nothing moved, and code makes the one commit and opens the pull request
through the code provider; reject cancels the task and sends nothing; answer sends it back with a comment. Any
other case opens a review whose body starts with the reason no effect was opened.

A task whose skill's runtime manifest sets mandatory_milestone is a milestone whatever its flow file says; the review
its run opens when it ends `done` says so and carries "mandatory_milestone": true in its payload.

With a documents platform, run_next reads it first (documents.pull) and runs nothing while a document the task's
skill declares was edited there and not taken; after the run, the documents it returned are written to it
(documents.push), and a failed write never fails the task. A document the mirror imported from the platform (a
person's edit) since a task's last run is named to that task's next run, when its skill reads it, in one line of
its prompt (EDITED_LINE): the content is the person's, not external content.

Releasing is not approving: a released delivery stays a draft in the project's state file.

The pending decision a run opens: a `question` when the run wrote nothing and asks (ending `question`); a
`review` otherwise. A draft with open questions (ending `draft_with_questions`) opens a review: the person
releases it as it stands, its open questions left in it, or answers it, and the task runs again. A run that
stopped on a missing input that another skill writes (ending `blocked`) opens nothing: the task is `blocked`, with
the start of the reply as its note, until the person retries it.

The layer is five files (CONS-1B, and ADJ-R1 for the fifth). The names every part shares (the checkout, the refusal, the project's context, the
locks, the runtime's own key, the data-folder names) live once in runtime/ops_core.py and are read as `core.<name>`
at call time, never bound at import, so that a test patching `ops_core.ROOT` reaches every reader. The conversation
(`say`, `chat_memory`) is runtime/ops_say.py and the reads of the local interface (`version`, `agents`, `skills`,
`costs`, `connections`, `artifacts`, ...) are runtime/ops_reads.py; both reach an operation that stays here at call
time, and this file exposes them under their names at its end, so a shell still imports `ops` only. The derived waits
between requests (contracts/runtime.md, "Derived waits") are runtime/ops_waits.py, which this file calls and which
reaches no operation of it. A test of size (runtime/tests/test_runtime_rules.py) caps this file and each sibling.

Usage (a library; the shell is runtime/cli.py): python3 runtime/ops.py --help

Standard library only. Runs on Python 3.9.
