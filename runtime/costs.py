"""The cost of the runs, recomputed from the token counts the adapter left in a run folder and the prices the person
typed into the project's configuration (model_prices, runtime/project_config.py).

The cost the store records for a run is the adapter's own number, and the reference model's adapter has no price for
the model: its runs carry no cost. So the page and the report recompute it: the tokens of each kind times the price of
that kind per million, summed. Arithmetic only. Nothing here guesses: a run whose folder holds no usage, or whose model
has no price, has no recomputed cost; it is `unknown`, and the summary counts it (`unknown_runs`).

  usage_of(run_dir)               the token counts of one run by kind, or None
  recompute(usage, price)         the cost in dollars of one usage at one price
  summary(runs, prices, since)    rows by day, agent, model and adapter

# attempt keeps only the last attempt's files (an earlier one is set aside beside them), so the tokens of such a run
