"""The five autonomy modes of an area agent, from the three facts under them, and the daily caps: the one module
that compares a mode word (decision D14 of the platform plan).

An area agent is an entry of "area_agents" in the project's configuration (runtime.json): a pack of skills, whether
it is enabled, its mode and two caps. The mode the person chose rests on three facts: whether the agent is enabled,
the checkpoints of its mode (every-phase, milestones, end) and whether a standing approval is in force for it. One
mapping (mode_of) turns the facts back into the mode the agent acts in now, so an agent set to
autonomous-with-policy whose approval expired acts as autonomous: its effects ask again.

  MODES, DEFAULT_MODE, CHECKPOINTS             MODES is also the order of autonomy, the least first
  narrows(old, new)                             whether a move from mode old to mode new is down that order
  agents(raw)                                   the checked "area_agents" ({} when absent; an absent cap is 0)
  facts(name, agents, standing, now)            {"enabled", "checkpoints", "standing"} of one agent
  mode_of(facts)                                the mode the agent acts in now
  state_checkpoints(agents)                     the value of the state file's "- Checkpoints:" line: the most careful
                                                among the enabled agents (every-phase when none is enabled)
  BILLINGS, RUNS_BILLINGS, SPEND_BILLINGS       the three billing words of a credential, and which cap counts each:
                                                subscription and free count runs (max_runs_per_day), metered counts
                                                dollars (max_usd_per_day); the word a run used is recorded on its row
  history_billing(run, floor_model)             the billing of a run row that has none (older than the column): the old
                                                tier rule, the floor model's runs are metered and any other's subscription
  with_billing(runs, floor_model)               the rows with that fallback filled in where the billing is null
  spend(runs, agent, per_run_usd)               a day's spend of one agent by billing: {"runs_counted", "usd_metered",
                                                "runs_without_cost"} (a metered run of unknown cost counts at per_run_usd)
  spend_split(runs, agent, per_run_usd)         the one place the day's rule is written: {"usd_recorded",
                                                "usd_reserved", "runs_total", "runs_counted", "runs_without_cost"};
                                                spend reads it (usd_metered = usd_recorded + usd_reserved, exactly)
  may_start(name, agents, facts, spent, billing)   (True, "") or (False, why): stopped, a cap reached for the billing of
                                                the run about to start, or a billing nobody knows
  review_action(task, pending, facts, proven, mandatory)   "release" or "hold": whether a mode releases a review
  covers(approval, policy_sha256, effect, executed_today, now, resolved=None)   (True, "") or (False, why): whether a
                                                standing approval covers one effect, inside every bound; a target
                                                that is a class word is covered only by what the caller resolved
  bounds_of(data, agent, effects)               a policy's bounds file, checked (docs/workbench/policies/<policy>.json);
                                                effects is the closed vocabulary of side effects, given by the caller
  block_bounds(policy, text, agent)             the bounds of a Markdown engagement policy, derived from its
                                                ```engagement-policy block (None when the text holds none)

A mode never releases a question; it releases a review only when the run ended `done` and wrote something (never a
`draft_with_questions`, an `unclassified` reply, a `done` whose reason says no file changed, or a blocked change set),
the skill is proven, and the task is not a milestone of its mode nor a mandatory milestone. Releasing is not
approving. An effect is executed without asking only inside an approved policy (covers, limit L15).
