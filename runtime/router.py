"""The router step of the task runtime: what code reads of one run of the router skill asked only for the route.

A request with no flow is routed by one run of the router skill (ROUTER_SKILL), as it is, with ROUTE_TASK_TEXT as
the task's text, so that the skill returns the route and starts nothing. Code reads only two things of the reply:
the route line and whether the reply asks. The route line is the first line of the skill's output template:

  Route: <name> (<capability or flow>, <ready or pending>)

A reply that asks (a line `Q<n>: ...`, also on the template's `Next:` line) is a question for the person, whatever
its route line says. A reply with exactly one route line is a route; anything else (no route line, `Route: none`,
a name in prose, two route lines) is unclassified and reaches the person whole. Nothing here guesses.

Functions:
  read_route(reply)                             {"kind": "question"} | {"kind": "route", ...} | {"kind": "unclassified", "why"}
  check_route(route, flow_names, pack_skills)   {"ok": true, "flow" | "skill"} | {"ok": false, "why"}

Pure: text in, a route out. It imports nothing of the lab or the store and calls no model.

Usage (a library; the shell is runtime/cli.py, verb route): python3 runtime/router.py --help

Standard library only. Runs on Python 3.9.
