"""The effect kind of the pull-request skill: one commit made by the code provider, then the pull request opened.

A kind is a module of runtime/ with these names, and a row of the registry runtime/effects.py KINDS (the key is the
side-effect word the skill's manifest names in its gate, gate.effect). The approval path of runtime/ops.py calls them
and knows nothing else of the kind:

    PROVIDER_CLASS                       the class of provider that executes it (found through providers/resolve.py)
    refusal(cfg, current)                why a task of this kind cannot start, or None
    head(cfg, task)                      the head branch the runtime names for the task
    prepare(current, copy, root, cfg, task, message)   puts the work copy in the form the skill was measured in
    parse(payload_text)                  the fields of the payload the skill showed at its gate, or None
    mismatch(parsed, cfg, task)          why the payload disagrees with the configuration, or None
    document(effect, cfg, request, payload, changeset, task, payload_file_sha256)   the effect document
    body(doc, sha256)                    what the person reads before approving
    title(doc), describe(doc)            the pending decision's title; one line that says what is approved
    summary(doc)                         what the pending decision's payload records of the effect
    unconfigured(cfg)                    why the configuration cannot carry the effect, or None
    verify(doc, changeset, facts, protected)   before execution: nothing moved since the gate
    execute(doc, changeset_dir, work_dir, provider, key_prefix, run=None)   the effect, by code

Usage (a library): python3 runtime/effect_pull_request.py --help

Standard library only. Runs on Python 3.9.
