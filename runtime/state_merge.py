"""The one module that decides what a run may change in the project's state file (docs/workbench/state.md),
limit L10 of the platform plan. No other module writes the state file.

The form of the file is contracts/state.md: a head (the lines before the first "## "), then the sections
"## Autonomy", "## Artifacts" (a table: Artifact, Owner skill, Status, Updated), "## Decisions" (lines
"- <date>: <text>. (<who>)"), "## Approvals" (a table) and "## Open questions" (lines "- [ ] <text>").

Of the state file a run left, the merge accepts three things, line by line, on top of what the project has now:
  - a row of ## Artifacts owned by the skill that ran, with the status `draft`, whose row the project did not
    change while the run was in progress;
  - a new line of ## Decisions attributed to the skill that ran (its last parenthesis starts with the skill's
    name and no item of it holds the word "user");
  - a new open question of ## Open questions, read in any list form ("- ...", "* ...", "1. ...", with or
    without "[ ]"; an OPEN-<n> mark stays part of its text) and written in the form of contracts/state.md,
    "- [ ] <text>", unless it is attributed to the person or to another skill. A question the project has is
    never closed, reworded or removed by a run, and each of those is refused with its own reason.
Everything else stays as the project has it, and each line refused is reported with its reason. Only code
writes what is the person's: an answer (with_answer()), "approved", the autonomy mode, the approval rows
(write_generated(), a copy of the store's approvals table).

Usage (a library): python3 runtime/state_merge.py --help

Standard library only. Runs on Python 3.9.
