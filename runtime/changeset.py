"""The change set: how code a run changed comes back (limit L9), and why a working document never enters a
commit (limit L11).

A versioned file (one the project's git tracks, or a new one its ignore rules would not keep out) never comes
back as a loose file: what a run did to versioned files is kept as one change set, in its run folder, until code
commits it through the code provider (runtime/effects.py). The change set is the difference between the copy's
base commit and its working tree, taken by git in the run's container with no network and a scratch index, under
the copy's own ignore rules, whatever the run did to its own index and history. The host then classifies every
path with the path rule, checks it, reads and hashes every file itself: it never runs git in a copy a run touched.

A path is refused, and the whole change set blocked, when it is not a regular file inside the copy (L8), is a path
the code provider does not take, is over the provider's size limit, holds a credential format (L14) or carries a
tool's settings (L4). A blocked change set is stored so the person can read it, and is never applied to a later task and never committed.

<run_dir>/changeset/changeset.json holds the change set, and <run_dir>/changeset/files/<path> each created or
changed file's bytes. Its "sha256" is the hash of the canonical form of its files and removed paths.

Public names: ChangesetError, LIMITS, SCRIPT, compute, store, load, current, apply, verify_for_commit,
versioned_in, provider_takes, canonical_sha256.
