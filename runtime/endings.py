"""How a run ended, for a run that did not fail: the classifier of endings.

The failures (a timeout, a refusal by the provider, a refused credential, a failure of the adapter, an early
end) are decided before this, by the lab's own functions (runtime/lab.py). This module reads a run that
completed and says which of the closed list it is:

  done                   the skill delivered: a declared output was written, and nothing is asked
  question               the skill stopped to ask and wrote nothing
  draft_with_questions   the skill wrote a declared output and still asks (an OPEN-<n> in it, or a closing question)
  gate                   the skill stopped at its confirmation gate          (recognised from stage 2 on)
  blocked                the skill stopped on a missing input                 (recognised from stage 2 on)
  unclassified           none of the rules below holds

It never guesses. A reply no rule recognises is `unclassified` and reaches the person whole. Without facts
(classify(..., facts=None)) it applies the first classifier's six rules (stage 1 of the platform plan). With the
facts of the skill that ran (manifest.ending_facts(), plus the run's own `outputs_present`), it recognises every
ending of the closed list, each from the run's facts, what the skill declares, or a sentence that comes from the
skills' own text (the comment beside each constant names the file). It is tested against the corpus of archived
lab runs (runtime/tests/corpus/endings.jsonl, runtime/tests/corpus/labels.json).

Usage:
  python3 runtime/endings.py --help
  python3 runtime/endings.py --corpus runtime/tests/corpus/endings.jsonl
      classify every line of a corpus with the facts of the line's skill (manifest.ending_facts) and print one
      JSON object {"lines", "by_ending", "stopped": {ending: n}, "changed": {ending: n}, "unclassified_ids"}

Standard library only. Runs on Python 3.9.
