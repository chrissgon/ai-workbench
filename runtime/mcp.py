"""The MCP mode: the operations layer of runtime/ops.py served as tools of a Model Context Protocol server over
standard input and output. A shell like the terminal's and the local service's: it parses a message, calls one
operation and returns what it returned. It holds no rule of its own about the work (which words a decision takes, what
a state leads to, what a hash must equal, which channel may approve an effect are the operations layer's and the
store's), reads no project file, and imports only the operations layer. It is a client's tool, not a person's: the
messaging apps an MCP client brings are the weaker trust surface the channel rule exists for.

Usage:
  python3 runtime/mcp.py --project <dir> [--project <dir>]...
  python3 runtime/mcp.py --help

  --project   a project folder (runtime/project_config.py); repeat for several. Each is checked at start with the
              `config` operation exactly as the local service does: a folder that is not a configured project ends the
              start (exit 3); a configuration you did not accept yet does not (the project is listed with
              "accepted": false, and every tool of it is refused with the status 412 "not_configured" until
              `accept-config` is typed in the terminal)

The client starts this process and speaks to it on its standard input and output: one JSON-RPC 2.0 message per line,
UTF-8, no line break inside a message (the protocol's stdio transport). Nothing but those messages is ever written to
standard output; the log goes to standard error and holds the method, the tool, the outcome and the duration of a call,
no argument and no result, and, when an operation fails in a way it did not expect (an internal failure), that failure's
traceback, which may name a path or quote the failing value; it holds no secret of the shell, which has none. There is no token: the client that started the process is the only reader of its
pipes. The process runs no background loop (`poll`, `dispatch`): the local service does, when the person starts it.

What a client gets. The methods `initialize`, `ping`, `tools/list` and `tools/call`; the notifications it sends
(`notifications/initialized`, `notifications/cancelled`, any other `notifications/...`) are accepted and need no
answer; any other method is -32601. The tools are, in the table's order, one per operation of runtime/operations.py
whose row lists the channel `mcp`, then two of the shell's own: `projects` (the projects served, with whether each
configuration is accepted) and `job` (a job asked for again). Every operation tool takes the operation's arguments by
name and `project` (the id `projects` shows: the first 12 hexadecimal characters of the sha256 of the project's real
path; optional when one project is served). The result is the operation's result as JSON in one text content; text
from the project (a document, a reply, a comment) is inside that JSON as a string and is never interpreted. An
operation that calls a model or a platform (the row's `job`) is started in a thread and answers at once with a job,
{"job", "op", "project", "state": "running", "result", "error", "started_at", "ended_at", "poll"}; the tool `job` with
{"job": <n>} returns it again, "state" "done" or "failed" at the end. A job that ends within one second is returned
ended. A job that calls a model is refused with "busy" while another such job of the project runs.

What is refused. A client of this channel may request, route, answer, release a draft and say, and read; nothing else.
An operation whose row does not list `mcp` has no tool (the table is read, nothing is spelled here): approve, reject,
cancel, retry, accept-config, run-next, the standing approvals and the others are done in the terminal or on the page,
where the person is. The same holds for a command typed into the tool `say`: the tool is called as the channel `mcp`
(a client cannot name another) and the operations layer does a command of a line only when its row lists that channel,
so "/approve", "/reject", "/retry" and "/cancel" in a line are refused with "/<command> is done in the terminal or on the
page". A model client must not authorise runs on its own request chain, and the hash of an effect is typed in the terminal
or clicked on the page, never sent from here.

A refusal of the operations layer (409 "refused", 412 "not_configured", "busy") is a tool result with "isError": true and
the sentence as its text content, as the protocol's tool-execution error. The protocol's error object is for the rest: its
message is the text and `data` is {"error": <word>, "status": <n>}, the words and statuses of the local service: 400
"usage" (code 2 of the operations layer, also an argument that does not fit the tool, with the code -32602), 404
"not_found", 500 "internal" (-32603; the traceback on standard error only). A message that is not JSON is -32700, one that
is not a request is -32600 (a batch is accepted, though the 2025-06-18 version dropped batches), an unknown method -32601,
an unknown tool or a bad argument -32602, a request before `initialize` -32002.

When it stops (standard input closed, SIGINT or SIGTERM) it ends the runs a job started (ops.stop_runs) and does not exit
before that returns; a second signal while it stops is ignored.

Exit codes: 0 stopped (input closed or a signal), 2 usage error, 3 a project is not configured.
Standard library only. Runs on Python 3.9.
