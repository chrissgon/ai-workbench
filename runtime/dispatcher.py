"""The dispatcher of the task runtime: what may start now, and what an autonomy mode releases, decided by one pure
function from a snapshot of the store.

decide(snapshot, review_action, may_start) -> {"release": [pending ids], "start": task id or None, "held": [...]}
held_of(snapshot, decided, blocked=None) -> [{"task_id", "agent", "reason"}]: every ready task a round did not start,
                with the reason, in the words of REASONS (the record `status` shows, runtime/ops.py)

  snapshot      {"running": <task or None>, "ready": [tasks, oldest first], "reviews": [{"pending", "task", "agent",
                "proven", "mandatory"}], "agents": {"<name>": {"facts", "spent", "entry"}}, "tier": {"<task id>":
                "strong" or "floor"}}, built by runtime/ops.py (dispatch, poll) from the store, the proof and the
                runtime manifests
  review_action runtime/autonomy.py's review_action(task, pending, facts, proven, mandatory): "release" or "hold"
  may_start     runtime/autonomy.py's may_start(name, agents, facts, spent, tier): (True, "") or (False, why)

Rules: (1) release holds every review the agent's mode releases; (2) while a task of the project runs, nothing
starts (one task at a time per project); (3) otherwise the ready tasks are walked oldest first: a task no enabled
area agent owns is held, a task whose agent may not start is held with the reason, and the first that may start is
started; (4) nothing else, and no state is changed here: runtime/ops.py applies the decision.

The two rule functions are passed in, so this file imports no sibling: the scheduler runs a copy of it alone (its
entry, stage 6). It reaches neither the store nor the lab facade.

The entry for the scheduler (stage 6). The scheduler starts a copy of this file, kept in its job folder, with the
system interpreter; so this file works alone, checks the project's configuration against the pin before it loads any
code the configuration points to, and only then loads the checkout:

  /usr/bin/python3 runtime/dispatcher.py poll  --project <dir> [--pin <file>]   ops.poll: the short job
  /usr/bin/python3 runtime/dispatcher.py work  --project <dir> [--pin <file>]   ops.dispatch: the worker
  /usr/bin/python3 runtime/dispatcher.py check --project <dir>                  can this interpreter run them?
  /usr/bin/python3 runtime/dispatcher.py command-file --job poll|work --project <dir> --pin <file>

With --pin (the file `cli.py pin` writes, <data_dir>/dispatch-pin.json), a runtime.json whose hash is not the pinned
one stops the job before anything of the checkout is imported. Without --pin a job may only be run by hand. poll and
work print one JSON object; an error of the operation is printed on stderr and ends with its exit code (1 failed, 2
usage, 3 not configured). check imports every module of runtime/ and runtime/handlers/, loads the lab's gate file,
says whether this interpreter can read the secret store and whether the reference model's credential is reachable,
and finds docker, uv and git on PATH; it starts nothing. command-file prints the scheduler's command file of one
job: argv[0] is always /usr/bin/python3, and the snapshot is this file and the pin.

Usage: python3 runtime/dispatcher.py --help

Standard library only. Runs on Python 3.9.
