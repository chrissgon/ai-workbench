"""A stand-in workbench tree for the tests of runtime/: an adapter that is a shell script, two invented skills
and one flow file, so that a run executes on this machine with no container and no model. Not a test file.

The stand-in adapter "h" is told what to do by files beside its script (adapters/h/), which a test writes:
  fail-times   a number: the first <n> calls fail as fail-kind says, the next ones behave
  fail-kind    timeout | adapter | refused | auth | limit | early
Each model call is appended to adapters/h/calls.txt as "<the skill staged, or none> <attempt number>".
Otherwise it acts by the skill staged in the copy:
  demo-asks    with no answer in the prompt it asks, with the skills' asking template, and writes nothing;
               with an answer it writes docs/business/market.md and a line in docs/workbench/state.md
  demo-writes  writes docs/business/icp.md from docs/business/market.md; without that input it says so
  demo-code    runs adapters/h/code.sh in the copy, when a test wrote one (with the attempt number as $1), and
               replies that it changed the files
  demo-gate    a skill with a confirmation gate: records the copy's branches, log and status in its output folder,
               writes payload.md in a folder from mktemp -d and replies in the pull-request skill's form; when a test
               wrote adapters/h/gate.sh it runs that instead (in the copy, with the output folder as $1)
