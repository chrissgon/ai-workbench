"""Tests of the page's live sync (WP-9.13): the watcher that asks the service for the change signal every second while the
tab is visible and reloads when it moves, the reload that every screen takes (the reads each view makes on a change), the
reload after any write the page sends, and the forced read of the snapshot. No browser and no model: the modules run
under Node with a fake clock, a fake document and a fake `fetch`, so what each screen asks the service is checked
(the paths, their number) without a service. The served page was looked at in a browser pane by the package's report.
