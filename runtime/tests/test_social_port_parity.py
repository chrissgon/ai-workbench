"""WP-7.1, from WP-7.3b on: the ported vote job is scripts/vote_job.py with a closed list of replacements.

runtime/handlers/social_vote_job.py was made with cp from scripts/vote_job.py and edited only as REPLACEMENTS
says. While the old script stays (until WP-7.5), this test keeps the two from drifting: a repair made to the
source must be made in the port too, and the other way round. Only that file is compared from WP-7.3b on:
social.py and social_vote.py now differ from scripts/runtime.py and scripts/runtime_vote.py by design (the
agent's run is a contained run, with the task text of the measured cases), so their entries are gone. The test
is retired at WP-7.6. The last test is about the handler's own command, not about parity: it checks that the
verbs the handler lists are the ones its parser takes.
