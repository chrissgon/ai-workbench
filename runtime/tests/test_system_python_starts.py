"""What the scheduler's jobs start runs on the system interpreter (stage 6, WP-6.7): every module of the runtime, and
every script a module starts with its own interpreter, is on the list the Python 3.9 job checks; what is not is
started through uv, git or bash, or by the lab through the facade. Offline: the sources are read, nothing is run.
