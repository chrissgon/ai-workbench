"""Tests of two sentences the plan gives the person (WP-9.14, items A-2 and A-3 of the maintainer's live test): the
refusal of a flow whose skills no enabled area agent has, which names the pack and what to add, and the title of a
request and of its plan, cut at a sentence or a word and never in the middle of one. Offline; invented names.
