"""Tests of the contained run (ops.contained_run, the terminal's `contained-run`, `platforms=` of lab.run_skill): one run of
one skill of an area agent's pack, in the eval container, for a caller that is not a task. Each of the four restrictions of
"The contained run" in contracts/runtime.md has its test here (R1 to R4 below). Offline: the stand-in tree and adapter of

with, the variables it saw and, when a test asks, a reply it makes); every name and every credential-shaped text is invented
