"""The corpus of archived lab runs (runtime/tests/corpus/endings.jsonl) is well formed, and the classifier of
endings never guesses on it. Offline: the corpus is a file; no model is called.

The corpus is built by runtime/tests/corpus/build_corpus.py from an archive of lab runs. This file checks its
form, the two things the first classifier must already hold on every line, and the total classifier (with the
facts of each line's skill, manifest.ending_facts): invariants on every line, the labels a person read
(runtime/tests/corpus/labels.json), and two ceilings on what stays unclassified, which only go down.

A corpus line does not record what the run's copy held, so no line carries `outputs_present`: the rule that names
a run that changed nothing `done` because its output is already there never fires here (test_endings_total.py
tests it).
