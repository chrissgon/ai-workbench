"""The lab facade: the one file of runtime/ that talks to the lab (evals/execution.py, the execution kit).

The agent runtime runs a skill in the container the skill was proven in, through the same entry: the eval
container of evals/executor.py, started by the adapter's run-prompt.sh, with the skill staged by
scripts/stage_skills.py. This file loads the execution kit, the one module the lab's runner (evals/eval_run.py)
and the runtime share, and calls the names its __all__ lists: the pause on the account limit, the shared lock,
the refusals, the early end, the replacement of passed values, and the stopping of everything a run started are
the kit's own code. The runner's own code (events, cases, baselines, grading, evidence) is not in the kit and is
not reachable from here; the status script is read through the names of the kit's STATUS_NAMES only.

The runtime has no loop of its own. The attempts of one run (prepare a fresh folder, run, classify how the attempt
failed, make it again or stop) are made by the one function the lab's runner calls too, run() of
evals/run_attempts.py, reached through the kit (load_attempts), so both hold one module object. What run_skill
adds through its hooks is the runtime's: the caller's files, the base commit, prepare and finish, the staging of
the one skill. Nothing that measures: no variant, no baseline, no contamination check, no shared-passage check, no
grading, no evidence line. The parity test (runtime/tests/test_lab_parity.py) gives the same adapter output to the
lab and to this file and expects the same classification.

Rule: no other module of runtime/ imports anything under evals/. They call the functions of this file.

Also here: run_command(), one command with no model and no credential, in the same container as a run (the
install of a project's dependencies, the difference a change set is taken from); and the hooks prepare and finish
of run_skill, through which the caller changes a fresh copy before the run and removes what must not come back.

Usage (a library; the terminal shell is runtime/cli.py):
  python3 runtime/lab.py --help        print this text
  python3 runtime/lab.py reference     print the reference model and its adapter, as JSON

Standard library only. Runs on Python 3.9.

    prompt   the task text, written to prompt.md
    files    [(absolute source path, path relative to the copy)]: what the run sees of the project. The caller
             decides the list; this function copies regular files and nothing else
    dest     the run folder (absolute). When the run ends, however it ends: <dest>/cwd is the copy as the run
             left it, <dest>/outputs the adapter's output (response.md, timing.json, raw.json, stderr.log),
             <dest>/prompt.md the task text; what an attempt that was made again left is in <dest>/failed-<n>/,
             <dest>/early-end-<n>/ or <dest>/paused-<n>/
    web      True runs on the open network and lets the model search and fetch pages (the adapter's --allow-web)
    tier     "strong" (the reference model) or "floor": the model, its adapter and the names of the variables
             that carry its credential come from evals/eval-gate.json. model, adapter and pass_env replace them
             (a test's stand-in); timeout (seconds) and retries default to the gate file's too
    prepare  prepare(copy_dir, root), called on every attempt after the base commit of the copy and before the
             check of a tool's settings: the caller changes the fresh copy (puts a dependency folder in, applies a
             change set)
    finish   finish(copy_dir, root), called on every attempt in which the adapter was started, after it returned
             and the changes were taken, before the last replacement of values and the return of the folders: the
             caller removes what must not be kept. An exception in either hook ends the run as LabError("copy")
    tmp_in_run  True points the run's temporary folder (TMPDIR) at a folder made in its fresh folder, which comes
             back as <dest>/outputs/tmp: what a skill writes under a folder from mktemp -d (the payload of its
             confirmation gate) is kept. TMPDIR is passed to the container by name, as the passed variables are; it
             is not a secret, so its value is never replaced in what the run left
    platforms  the platforms whose reference the caller names, a list of names ("a case's platforms"): each is
             staged beside the skill, with its data file when it has one, as the lab stages a case's platforms. The
             list is added to what platforms_cited() gives, never in its place; a name with no reference under
             shared/references/platforms/ is LabError("config"). None, the default, adds none

    (each after the gate file's retries, "auth" at once), "settings" (the copy carries a tool's settings) and
    "stopped". Raises LabError when no run could be made (configuration, container, a file that may not enter).
