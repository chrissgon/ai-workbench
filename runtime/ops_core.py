"""The names every module of the operations layer shares, once: the checkout (ROOT), the refusal (OpsError), the
project's context and the store call, the two locks, the runtime's own key and the data-folder names.

The operations layer is four files: runtime/ops.py (the operations and the facade every shell imports),
runtime/ops_say.py (the conversation), runtime/ops_reads.py (the reads of the local interface) and this one. Every
module reads a name of this file as an attribute of it, at call time (`import ops_core as core`, then `core.ROOT`,
`core.context(...)`), and never binds one at import (no module takes a name of this file with a from-import): a test
that patches `ops_core.ROOT` then reaches every reader, and a copy bound at import would keep the real checkout. No name
here is an operation, and this file imports no other file of the layer (runtime/tests/test_runtime_rules.py).

Standard library only. Runs on Python 3.9.
