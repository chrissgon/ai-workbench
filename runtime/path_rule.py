"""The path rule: how one path of what a run left goes back to the project. One function, no file access.

Every file a run created or changed is given exactly one class, by its path relative to the project root:

  state      docs/workbench/state.md: it goes back through the merge of runtime/state_merge.py, never as a file
  machine    a file no person edits: everything under .workbench-local/, every file under docs/ that is not
             Markdown (a lint record, a check report, a data file, an image), and a document bound to an
             approval by its hash (facts["bound"])
  document   a Markdown file under docs/: text a person reads and edits where the project keeps it
  versioned  a file the project's git tracks or would track (facts["versioned"]): it goes back as part of a
             change set, never as a loose file (stage 4 of the platform plan supplies the fact)
  ignored    what the runtime itself put in the copy or what no one reads back: the folder the skills were
             staged in (facts["staged"]), version control, dependency and cache folders. Dropped, not listed
  other      anything else, the runtime's own configuration (docs/workbench/runtime.json) included. Not
             returned, and listed for the person

Usage (a library):
  python3 runtime/path_rule.py --help
  python3 runtime/path_rule.py <relative path>...    print the class of each path, as JSON

Standard library only. Runs on Python 3.9.
