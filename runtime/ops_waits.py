"""The derived waits in the operations layer: which task waits for which, worked out from the artifact contract.

A person adds requests in any order, on the page, in the terminal or on the task board. This part of the layer knows
what each task needs (the inputs its skill declares) and what each open task will write (the outputs of its skill),
and makes a task wait for the open task of another request that writes an input the project does not have yet
(runtime/plan.py, derive, is the pure rule). The wait is stored with its reason (the store's task_waits); a task with
an open wait stays `planned`, and the store gives it out to no one (providers/store/sqlite.py). The person's
override, "after request #n", is a request's own field and becomes the same kind of wait; "go ahead" on a plan's
task drops its derived waits and is recorded in the state file as the person's decision.

Functions (each takes the project's context, ops_core.context):
  rederive(ctx)                           recompute the waits of every task not yet started and bring the store to
                                          them; a request that is the only open one, with no override, has none to
                                          compute and costs no read of the skills
  for_plan(ctx, tasks, after, go_ahead, request)   the waits the tasks of a plan not created yet begin with (request:
