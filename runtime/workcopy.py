"""What enters a run copy, and what comes back from it: the limits of the task runtime that decide which files
of a project a run sees (L1 to L6) and which files a run leaves come back (L7, L8, L12, L14).

What enters (entering()):
  L1  every run starts from a new copy, with the skill staged again: the lab facade makes a new run root and
      stages the skill on every attempt (runtime/lab.py), with the shared references it cites and, when it cites
      the platforms' folder, every platform's reference (lab.platforms_cited()), read-only; nothing here keeps
      a copy between runs
  L2  a run without the web sees the versioned files (git ls-files, with the person's git), the project's
      documents and state file under docs/, the machine files the skill declares, and the files the person
      handed over to this task (the file drop, runtime/drop.py; those of another task never). No other file
      outside git. The store, the runtime's data and its configuration never
  L3  a run with the web sees only the artifacts its skill declares (strict form: no allowance for web and
      code together is built; a handed-over file enters a web task only if drop.WEB_TASK_TAKES_DROP is true)
  L4  a path with a part that carries a tool's settings never enters, at any depth
  L5  the project's AGENTS.md enters only when the skill declares it, without the two lines the container
      cannot serve; when a protected path covers it and the skill is not of a code area, only its workbench
      section enters
  L6  no credential enters: a credential file by its name, a file too large to scan, a file whose text holds
      what looks like a credential

Every file left out is listed with its reason, except a path inside a folder the path rule drops.

What comes back (returning()), for a run that completed:
  L7  the destination of each file comes from the path rule (runtime/path_rule.py); a document bound to an
      approval, or a machine file the skill's manifest names, comes back as a machine file
  L8  only a regular file, with its real path inside the copy, comes back
  L12 a file that changed in the project since the copy was made is never overwritten
  L14 everything passes the credential scan before it leaves the copy; the reply the person reads is masked
      line by line (masked_reply())
Nothing is deleted in the project because a run deleted it. The state file comes back through
runtime/state_merge.py only.

Usage (a library): python3 runtime/workcopy.py --help

Standard library only. Runs on Python 3.9.
