"""What the two network-free shells of the operations layer share: the local service (runtime/service.py) and the MCP
mode (runtime/mcp.py). One source for the pieces both used to carry as copies, and nothing else:

  - project_id, projects_of: the id a project has in a URL or a tool argument, and the project list checked at start;
  - STATUS_OF_CODE, status_of: the one mapping of an OpsError code to the status and the word a shell answers with;
  - EXPOSED_KINDS: the argument kinds of a row of the table that a shell can carry in JSON;
  - Jobs: the job registry (start, poll, keep, end the runs) and the project list of the `projects` answer;
  - Busy, Stopping: what a start of a job raises, for a shell to turn into its own answer.

It holds no rule about the work (which words a decision takes, what a state leads to, which channel may approve an
effect are the operations layer's and the store's), no request rule of a shell (the service's Host, Origin and token
checks, the MCP mode's channel) and reads no project file. It imports nothing of the runtime: the operations object a
shell works with (the module ops, or a stand-in) is given to it, and the layer map lets a shell import ops.py and this
module only. Standard library only. Runs on Python 3.9.
