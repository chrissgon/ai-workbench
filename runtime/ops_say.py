"""The conversation with the planning agent: one turn of it (`say`) and the memory a plain line carries to the router.

A sibling of runtime/ops.py, which exposes `say` and `chat_memory` under their names; no shell imports this file. The
names every module of the layer shares are read as `core.<name>` (runtime/ops_core.py); an operation or a helper that
stays in runtime/ops.py is reached at call time through `_ops()`, never imported at module level, so that the two
files do not import each other.

A line typed while a run of the project is in progress is not refused: it is stored with its reply pending (the
queue below) and `route_queued` answers it when the run lock is free; a plain line that asks about the state is
answered at once, by code, from the store's records; a reply of the router that is a direct turn (route `none`,
shape `direct`) is answered the same way, with the router's `Next` line; a reply that names no route opens a
question with a sentence and two actions. The reasons and the shapes are in contracts/runtime.md, "The conversation".

Standard library only. Runs on Python 3.9.
