"""The file drop: how a person hands a file to one task (a logo made elsewhere, a spreadsheet), since the runtime
has no image provider.

A file handed over is copied into <project>/.workbench-local/drop/<task id>/ (DROP_DIR). It enters the run copy of
that task, at the same relative path, and of no other task (runtime/workcopy.py, limit L2); the run's prompt lists
it (ops.task_prompt, handed=); whatever a run leaves in the drop folder is dropped on the way back (the folder is
staged for the path rule), so a run cannot change what the person handed over.

  hand_over(project, task, source, web_allowed)   copy one file into the task's folder; refused, each with its own
                                                  message (DropError), when: the source is a link or not a regular
                                                  file; its name does not match NAME; it is larger than MAX_BYTES; a
                                                  file of that name is already there (a hand-over never replaces
                                                  one); the task is done, cancelled or running; the file is text
                                                  and holds what looks like a credential (limit L6); the project is
                                                  a git repository that does not ignore the drop (a handed-over file
                                                  must never reach a commit); the task's skill uses the web and
                                                  web_allowed is false (limit L3)
  files(project, task_id)                         the regular files of a task's folder, sorted

WEB_TASK_TAKES_DROP stays False until the maintainer answers question 3 of part 3 of the platform plan: a web task
receives only the artifacts its skill declares. It changes only in a pull request that quotes that answer.

Usage (a library; the shell is runtime/cli.py hand-over): python3 runtime/drop.py --help

Standard library only. Runs on Python 3.9.
