// The Lobby's Inbox tab (handoff lobby.md, "Inbox tab"): the Floor's Inbox (floor/inbox.js and its cards) fed with the planning agent's
// open decisions, those with no agent (a decision on a request) and those of the planning agent. A plan on a request that a message
// of the planning agent names has its card under that message in the Conversation; here it is a line that points there, so a plan
// card is drawn in one place only (OPEN-24). Every other decision has its card here. This module draws and hands the cards their
// environment; every write is sent by the Floor's cards through floor/actions.js.
