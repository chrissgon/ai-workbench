// What the City's "Add a project" and "Leave this project" show (A-24), worked out with no document and no network. The page never opens a folder
// and never starts the service: a project enters the service, or leaves it, by the person's hand in the terminal, so the page shows the restart
// line with the folders it holds and the one that changes (`--project` repeated), and, for a folder with no configuration, the line that makes one.
//
// Where each piece comes from: the head of the restart line (everything before the first `--project`: the runner and the service's script) is the
// service's own start line, read from `connections.service.start` of an accepted project, which carries the absolute path of this checkout; the
// folders of the projects it holds are the folders of their configuration files (`status.config.path`, minus the configuration's own place); the
// folder to add is what the person typed. A folder the page does not know (a project never accepted) is written `<folder of NAME>`, to be replaced.
// When the service's start line cannot be read, the head is the known form with the checkout left for the person to fill in.
