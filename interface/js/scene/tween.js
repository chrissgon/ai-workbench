// The camera move as a small state machine, with no document, so a test can run it. One move at a time: a new move, a cancel (the
// scene was rebuilt, the preference changed, the screen was left) settles the one in flight with `false`, so whoever waits for it is
// never left hanging; finishing settles it with `true`. A move may settle with `true` earlier, at a fraction of its progress
// (`settleAt`): the screen that waits for it can be opened while the camera is still on its way, as the prototype's one camera did,
// and the move still runs to its end.
//
// The move is the prototype's (prototype-motion.js): the camera's centre and zoom (the reciprocal of the frustum's half width, as
// `cam.zoom`) each approach their goal by `1 - exp(-dt * 4.5)` a frame, stepped by frame time, so a slow frame slows the move. The goal
// may change while the camera is on its way (`retarget`: the page's panels appear when the route changes and the free rectangle
// with them): the camera carries on from where it is, no jump. A move ends when it is within one percent of its distance and snaps.
