// that also holds the edge lines of its boxes (kit.box with `edges`), the lot's theme line and the like; three.js tests a line
// against a ray within a threshold of one world unit, whether the line is visible or not, so a line on the far side of a rack
// "hit" the pointer when it was a unit away from it and, being nearer the camera, won over the mesh the pointer was on. That is
// how the tooltip named the first of three racks while the pointer stood on the third. A line is never pickable; a hidden mesh
// is not either; a mesh belongs to the nearest pickable group above it (the Lobby's door stands inside its floor and wins there).
