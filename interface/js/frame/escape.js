// The Escape key, in one place (WP-9.11). The page had a handler in each screen and they disagreed: in the Control room and in the Lobby
// Escape did nothing after the person had used an object. One handler, one order, stopping at the first step that applies:
//   1. a field has the focus: nothing (a draft is not thrown away);
//   2. a dialog is open: it closes;
//   3. a document or a selected decision is open in the Floor or the Lobby: it closes (a document back to the tab it was opened from, a
//      decision to the Inbox list);
//   4. a menu or a list is open (the project switcher, the open "Waiting for you" card, the command panel of the switcher's foot, the request list): it closes;
//   5. a scene object is selected or hovered by the keyboard: the selection is cleared;
//   6. else go up: the Floor and the Lobby to the Building, the Building to the City (`#/city`; on the home Building of a service with one
//      project, nothing: the City is its crumb), the Control room to the screen it was opened from (else the Building of the project).
// Pure: no document and no window, so a test can run every step.
