// What the Tasks tab shows, worked out from what the operations returned: pure functions with no document and no network, so they
// run under a test. The tasks are the rows of `status` that belong to one floor (floor-model.agentTasks: a task with no agent
// is the planning agent's, so the Lobby takes `planning` and null); the body of a task (`task`) adds the age, the paths a done
// task returned, the failure of a failed one and its runs. Nothing is decided here: a group is a closed list of states, an
// action is a word the state allows, and a value that is not known is shown as "unknown" or as a dash.
