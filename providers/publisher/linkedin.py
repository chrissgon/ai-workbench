"""Publisher provider for LinkedIn: publish a post, and comment on it, as the authenticated member.

  {hashtag|\\#|MyTestTag} of its Posts API example) used by the commentary field:
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/community-management/shares/little-text-format?view=li-lms-2026-09
- Comments API (accessed 2026-09-29): POST /rest/socialActions/{shareUrn|ugcPostUrn|commentUrn}/comments,
  body actor/object/message.text, parentComment for a nested reply, x-restli-id and commentUrn in the
  answer, comment URN urn:li:comment:(<thread urn>,<id>), 429 "Comment create throttled". The comment
  message is text plus attributes, not little text, so it is sent unescaped:

- API versioning (latest version header 202609, versions supported at least one year):

- Share on LinkedIn product (grants w_member_social; author is urn:li:person:{sub}):

- Authorization code flow (60-day access tokens; programmatic refresh only for a limited set of partners):
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow

At most one post, or one comment, per idempotency key: the key is recorded as pending in the
local ledger, under a file lock, before anything is sent, and as published with the post or
comment URN after the answer. A pending key whose outcome is unknown (a timeout, a crash) blocks every new attempt
until `resolve` records what happened. Redirects are refused, so the bearer token is only
ever sent to the URL that was checked.

The ledger lives in a data folder (~/Library/Application Support/ai-workbench/ on macOS,
$XDG_DATA_HOME/ai-workbench/ or ~/.local/share/ai-workbench/ elsewhere), next to the scheduler's jobs.
It used to live in the cache folder, where clearing the cache lost the record of what was already
published; on first use the old ledger is copied to the new place (a note on stderr says so) and is
never deleted. Jobs scheduled before this change run a copy of the old provider and keep writing to the
old location, so they must be scheduled again after upgrading.

verbs:
  publish   Publish one post as the authenticated member. Needs
            --idempotency-key and --confirmed (or --dry-run). Refuses --at in
            the future: scheduling belongs to the scheduler class, not to this
            provider. The dry run reads no token and calls nothing. The text
            is escaped for the little text format, except that a #word (ASCII
            letters, digits, _) becomes a hashtag; @name stays plain text.
            --first-comment-file <f> also posts that file as a comment on the
            post, with the key <post key>{FIRST_COMMENT_SUFFIX}: one command, one approval.
            If the post goes out and the comment fails, the JSON has the
            post_urn and first_comment_error and the exit code is 1; rerunning
            the same command replays the post and retries only the comment.
  comment   Comment on a post as the authenticated member: --text-file <f>,
            --idempotency-key <k>, and the post by --on-key <the post's
            publish key> (it must be published) or --post-urn <urn:li:share:N,
            urn:li:ugcPost:N or urn:li:activity:N>. --parent-comment
            <urn:li:comment:(urn:li:activity:N,N)> makes it a reply. Needs
            --confirmed (or --dry-run). The text is sent as written: comments
            do not use the little text format.
  resolve   Settle a key left pending by a timeout or a crash, after checking
            the member's recent posts or the post's comments: --post-urn <urn>
            (the post was published), --comment-urn <urn> (the comment was) or
            --not-published (it was not; the key may be used again). Needs
            --confirmed.

idempotency:
  Each key publishes one post or one comment at most once. It is recorded as pending in the ledger
  before the request and as published after it, under a file lock; a pending
  key refuses every new attempt until resolve settles it.

credentials (never from files or flags):
  The access token is read from the OS secret store (service "{KEYRING_SERVICE}",
  username "{KEYRING_USERNAME}"), written there by:
      uv run providers/publisher/auth.py --provider linkedin
  LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN        optional; an access token taken from the
                               environment instead of the secret store.
  LINKEDIN_TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT    optional; ISO-8601 expiry of LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN.

other environment variables:
  PUBLISHER_LINKEDIN_COMMENT_RETRY_DELAYS  seconds to wait before each retry of a first comment that
                               LinkedIn answers with 404 right after the post is created (it does, for
                               a few seconds, longer with an image). Default: 5,15,30,60. Other
                               refusals are not retried.
  PUBLISHER_LINKEDIN_LEDGER    path of the idempotency ledger (JSON). Default, in a data folder:
                               ~/Library/Application Support/ai-workbench/publisher-linkedin.json
                               on macOS; elsewhere $XDG_DATA_HOME/ai-workbench/publisher-linkedin.json,
                               or ~/.local/share/ai-workbench/publisher-linkedin.json. A ledger at
                               its old place ($XDG_CACHE_HOME/ai-workbench/ or ~/.cache/ai-workbench/)
                               is copied there on first use and never deleted.
  LINKEDIN_API_BASE            tests only. Replaces {DEFAULT_API_BASE} with a
                               loopback URL (http://127.0.0.1:<port>). Any other
                               host is refused. When set, the secret store is not
                               read; the token must come from LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN.
  LINKEDIN_HTTP_TIMEOUT        tests only, with LINKEDIN_API_BASE: seconds before
                               a request times out (default {HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS}).

output:
  publish: JSON on stdout with post_urn, post_url, token_expires_at,
  token_expires_in_days, idempotency_key, replayed, and with
  --first-comment-file, first_comment (comment_urn, idempotency_key, replayed)
  or first_comment_error.
  comment: comment_urn, post_urn, parent_comment, idempotency_key, replayed,
  token_expires_at, token_expires_in_days.
  Diagnostics on stderr. Tokens are never printed.

exit codes: 0 success, 1 provider or service error, 2 usage error, 3 not configured.

LinkedIn API version pinned: {LINKEDIN_VERSION}. Access tokens last 60 days and
there is no refresh token for self-serve apps: rerun auth.py before expiry.
