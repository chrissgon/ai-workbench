"""Resolve a requirement class to the provider script that satisfies it.

This is the one place that turns a class from contracts/environment.md (`scheduler:job`,
`publisher:<platform>`, `integration:vcs`) into a script under providers/. Skills, the agent
runtime and scripts/doctor.py all ask here; none of them names an implementation.

Usage:
  python3 providers/resolve.py --class <class> [--json] [--root <workbench root>]
  python3 providers/resolve.py --list [--root <workbench root>]
  python3 providers/resolve.py --help

  --class <class>  print the absolute path of the provider script chosen for the class
                   (with --json: class, implementation, path, source, variables)
  --list           print, as JSON, every class with its folder, its variables, the
                   implementations shipped and the one that resolves now
  --root <path>    the workbench checkout to look in, instead of WORKBENCH_ROOT

A class is <role>:<target> (providers/CONTRACT.md). How it maps to a folder and to its variables:
  <role>:<target>        -> providers/<role>/      generator:image -> providers/generator/
                            <ROLE>_<TARGET>_PROVIDER, then <ROLE>_PROVIDER
  integration:<service>  -> providers/<service>/   integration:vcs -> providers/vcs/
                            INTEGRATION_<SERVICE>_PROVIDER only: one integration never serves another
  the four classes of the table FIXED keep the folder and the variable they had when their names
  were bare:
    reader:email   -> providers/mailbox/    MAILBOX_PROVIDER
    sender:email   -> providers/mailer/     MAILER_PROVIDER
    scheduler:job  -> providers/scheduler/  SCHEDULER_PROVIDER
    store:runtime  -> providers/store/      STORE_PROVIDER
  Their old names (mailbox, mailer, scheduler, store) are still read, as aliases: a job scheduled
  before the rename runs a copy of the runtime that asks for `store`.
An implementation is providers/<folder>/<name>.py; helpers next to it (auth.py) are not one.

A class with a parameter. In `publisher:<platform>` the part after the colon is not a second name
of the class: it is handed to the implementation as --platform, and one implementation may serve
several platforms. Each implementation of such a class declares the platforms it serves in one
line at the top level of its file, `PLATFORMS = ("<platform>", ...)`, which is read here as text,
without importing the file. `publisher:<p>` is resolved among the implementations that serve <p>;
an implementation that declares nothing serves nothing. Written with the placeholder
(`publisher:<platform>`) the class means "any platform": every implementation is a candidate.

How the implementation is chosen, first match wins:
  0. An implementation the caller names explicitly (the function's `implementation` argument;
     the runtime passes what a project's runtime.json names). Not available on the command line.
  1. The environment, most specific variable first (PUBLISHER_<PLATFORM>_PROVIDER, then
     PUBLISHER_PROVIDER; a hyphen becomes "_"). For a class with a parameter the general variable
     is a preference: when the implementation it names does not serve the platform asked, it is
     passed over, so that a variable set for a first platform does not break a second.
  2. The platform default, where the class has one and that implementation is shipped:
     scheduler:job is launchd on macOS and systemd on Linux.
  3. The only candidate, when exactly one implementation is left.
Otherwise nothing resolves (exit 3): the message names the variable to set and the choices.
A name from the environment or the caller is accepted only when it is an implementation shipped
in the class's folder (and, for a class with a parameter, one that serves the platform asked);
it is never used as a path.

environment variables:
  WORKBENCH_ROOT            the workbench checkout a project uses (an absolute path). Default:
                            the checkout this script is in.
  <ROLE>[_<TARGET>]_PROVIDER      the implementation of a class, as above.

output: the path on stdout (JSON with --json or --list); diagnostics on stderr.
exit codes: 0 resolved, 2 usage error or unknown class, 3 nothing resolves.
Standard library only. Runs on the system interpreter (Python 3.9): the scheduled runtime
imports it (providers/CONTRACT.md, "Python version").
