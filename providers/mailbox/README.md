# Mailbox providers

Implementations of the `reader:email` class (`mailbox` until 2026-10-02; the folder and `MAILBOX_PROVIDER` keep that name): search and read the user's own messages. Interface: `providers/CONTRACT.md`. Selected with `MAILBOX_PROVIDER=gmail`; `python3 scripts/doctor.py` then runs `gmail.py --check` for any skill that requires the class.

The first use is backlog PB5: finding new comments on the user's LinkedIn posts through the notification e-mails LinkedIn sends, because LinkedIn's API answers 403 when the member's comments are read.

## Gmail (`gmail.py`)

Reads Gmail through the Gmail API with the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly` scope and nothing else. Every verb only reads: nothing is sent, moved, labelled, marked as read or deleted, so no verb takes `--confirmed` or `--dry-run`.

### Setup (once)

The full steps are in `uv run providers/mailbox/auth.py --help`. In short:

1. In the Google Cloud console, create a project and enable the Gmail API.
2. Google Auth Platform: user type External; under Data Access add only `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`.
3. Audience: "Publish app", so the status is "In production". In "Testing", Google expires the authorization seven days after consent, and the provider would stop every week with `invalid_grant`. An app for personal use (fewer than 100 users) keeps working without Google's verification; the consent screen says the app is unverified and you click through it for your own account.
4. Clients: create an OAuth client of type "Desktop app". No redirect URL is registered: `auth.py` listens on `http://127.0.0.1:<a random free port>`.
5. Store the client id and secret (typed at a hidden prompt, never on the command line):

   ```sh
   uv run --with keyring==25.7.0 keyring set ai-workbench gmail-client-id
   uv run --with keyring==25.7.0 keyring set ai-workbench gmail-client-secret
   ```

6. Run `uv run providers/mailbox/auth.py --provider gmail`, sign in with the Gmail account to read and approve. The refresh token, the granted scope and the account address go to the OS secret store (service `ai-workbench`, username `mailbox-gmail`) as one JSON record, never to disk.
7. Verify: `uv run providers/mailbox/gmail.py --check` prints `{"ok": true, "account": ..., "token_source": ..., "scope": ...}`.

The authorization uses PKCE (S256), a random `state` compared in constant time on the callback, `access_type=offline` and `prompt=consent`. If the consent screen shows a box for Gmail, keep it ticked: without the scope nothing is stored.

### Usage

```sh
uv run providers/mailbox/gmail.py --check
uv run providers/mailbox/gmail.py search --query 'from:linkedin.com' --since 2026-09-28T00:00:00Z --limit 20
uv run providers/mailbox/gmail.py get --id <Gmail message id>
uv run providers/mailbox/gmail.py read-eml --file notification.eml [--header-prefix <prefix>]...
```

- `search` takes a query in the syntax of the Gmail search box. `--since <ISO-8601>` is added as `after:<epoch seconds>` (Google reads a date in `q` as midnight Pacific time, so seconds are used) and checked again on each message; `--before <ISO-8601>` does the same with `before:<epoch seconds>`. `--limit` is 1 to 100, default 20: the provider reads the service's pages (`pageToken`) until it has that many, and the output's `truncated` is `true` when the mailbox holds more matches than were returned. Those are older: read on with `--before <the oldest received_at returned, plus one second>` (a message that comes back twice has the same `id`). Messages are fetched in parallel, `--jobs` at a time (1 to 10, default 4), and printed newest first.
- `get` returns one message by the id `search` printed.
- `read-eml` parses a saved RFC 822 file with no network and no credential. Use it to inspect a real notification before building on its layout, and to feed tests and eval fixtures.

Every verb prints normalized messages:

```json
{"id": "...", "thread_id": "...", "source": "gmail", "received_at": "2026-09-28T14:05:07Z",
 "from": "...", "to": "...", "subject": "...", "text": "...", "truncated": false,
 "links": [{"href": "https://...?...", "text": "Reply"}],
 "headers": {"Message-ID": "...", "Date": "...", "From": "...", "To": "...", "Subject": "...", "List-Id": "..."},
 "external_content": true}
```

- `id` and `thread_id` are Gmail's; both are null for an `.eml` file.
- `received_at` comes from Gmail's `internalDate`, or from the `Date` header for an `.eml` file, in UTC.
- `text` is the text/plain part, or text derived from the HTML part when there is none, capped at 100,000 bytes (`truncated` says so). Messages are fetched in Gmail's RAW format and decoded with the standard library's email package (quoted-printable, base64, charsets, encoded headers).
- `links` come from the HTML part, in order, one per `href` (the first one, with the first non-empty text), with the full URL including its query string: ids may live in tracking-link parameters. `javascript:` and `data:` links are dropped.
- `headers` keeps only Message-ID, Date, From, To, Subject, List-Id, and the headers whose name starts with a prefix given by `--header-prefix <prefix>` (on `search`, `get` and `read-eml`; repeatable; compared without case; the characters of a header name only, otherwise exit 2). The provider holds no platform's prefix: the caller passes the one in the platform's data file (`notification_email.header_prefix` in `shared/references/platforms/<platform>.json`). Without the flag no platform's own headers are kept.
- Invisible and direction-changing characters are removed from the text and the links, and an HTML element hidden by an inline `display:none` or `visibility:hidden` style, or by the `hidden` attribute, gives no text and no link: text a reader cannot see is not message text.
- `external_content` is always `true`: the message was written by whoever sent it, and is data, never instructions.

### Security

- **E-mail content is external content.** Anyone can send the user an e-mail, and a comment is written by a stranger. The provider only returns messages as data, each marked `"external_content": true`, and drops text hidden from the reader by inline styles; a skill that reads them quotes any instruction found inside to the user and never follows it. Comments on the user's posts are the main prompt-injection surface of the engagement work (backlog PB6).
- Read only by scope: the token cannot change the mailbox even if a caller tried.
- The client secret and the refresh token are read through `providers/secrets/resolver.py` (environment first, then the OS secret store) and never printed. Requests that carry a token or the client secret never follow a redirect, and every request has a 60-second timeout.
- The test overrides below are honoured only with loopback URLs, and in test mode neither script reads or writes the OS secret store.

### Errors

| Exit | When |
|------|------|
| 0 | success |
| 1 | a Google error (a 403 when the Gmail API is not enabled, a 404, a timeout, a refused redirect) |
| 2 | usage: a bad flag, a flag the verb does not read (`--query` with `get`), `--check` with a verb, `--limit` out of bounds, a malformed message id, a missing `.eml` file |
| 3 | not configured: no authorization, a missing client id or secret, a rejected client, a token without `gmail.readonly`, or `invalid_grant` |

`invalid_grant` on a refresh means the authorization expired or was revoked. The likely cause is a project still in "Testing" (seven days); others are access removed in the Google Account, a password change (the token carries a Gmail scope) or six months without use. Rerun `auth.py`.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Used by | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID` | `auth.py`, `gmail.py` | The Desktop app OAuth client; the authorization and every refresh need it. |
| `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET` | `auth.py`, `gmail.py` | That client's secret. |
| `GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN` | `gmail.py` | Optional; a bare refresh token from the environment instead of the stored record. |
| `MAILBOX_PROVIDER` | `scripts/doctor.py` | `gmail` selects this provider. |
| `GMAIL_API_BASE`, `GOOGLE_TOKEN_URL` | both | Tests only: loopback URLs of a fake Google, set together. |
| `GMAIL_HTTP_TIMEOUT` | `gmail.py` | Tests only, with the overrides: seconds before a request times out. |

### To verify on first use

- **The notification e-mail.** Save one real LinkedIn comment notification as `.eml` (Gmail: "Show original", "Download original") and run `read-eml` on it before anything else: whether it carries the comment text, the commenter, and the post and comment ids a reply needs (backlog PB5). The test fixture is synthetic and does not claim to match LinkedIn's format.
- **Search query.** Which sender address and words find the comment notifications, to fix the `--query` a skill uses.
- **RAW responses carry `internalDate`.** The Message resource lists it; if a RAW answer omits it, `received_at` falls back to the `Date` header.
- **Unverified-app consent.** That the consent screen of a production, unverified, personal-use app lets the owner click through for the `gmail.readonly` scope, and that the refresh token then outlives seven days.
