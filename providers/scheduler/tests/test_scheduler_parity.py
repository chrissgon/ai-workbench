"""The functions launchd.py and systemd.py share are the same text in both files.

The two scheduler providers are separate files because a job runs a copy of one of them, alone, with the
system interpreter: they cannot import a common module. So what they share is written twice, and a fix to
the snapshot, the lock or the hash check in one file must reach the other. This test is what makes that
happen: a function of SHARED that differs fails here, and so does a function both files define that is on
neither list.
