"""Scheduler provider for macOS: run a command through launchd, once at a set time or every N minutes.

Sources (Apple documentation and manual pages, accessed 2026-09-26 and 2026-09-29):
- launchd.plist(5): StartCalendarInterval (Month, Day, Hour, Minute in local time; a
  missed interval while the computer sleeps fires once on wake), ProgramArguments,
  WorkingDirectory, EnvironmentVariables, StandardOutPath, StandardErrorPath.
- launchd.plist(5), man page dated 30 July 2019, read on macOS 27.0.1 on 2026-09-29:
  StartInterval starts the job every N seconds; a firing due while the system is asleep
  is missed, and a firing due while the job is still running is missed too. RunAtLoad
  defaults to false, so the first firing comes one interval after loading.
- launchctl(1): `bootstrap gui/<uid> <plist>` loads a user agent, `bootout gui/<uid>/<label>`
  unloads it and stops its processes.
- Creating Launch Daemons and Agents (Daemons and Services Programming Guide):
  https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html

What a job guarantees:
- Every file the command reads through its arguments is in the command file's "snapshot":
  an argument that names an existing file, bare or as --flag=/path (absolute or relative to
  cwd), and is not listed there makes the job refused. The files are copied into the job
  folder with their SHA-256 and the arguments are swapped for the copies, so switching
  branches or editing the originals cannot change what runs.
- The scheduled program (argv[0]) and this runner script are hashed too; the runner itself is
  copied into the job folder and launchd calls the copy.
- The hashes are fixed at approval: the dry run prints a digest of everything that will run,
  and the confirmed call must pass it back with --approved. At run time the copies, the
  program and the runner are hashed again and the command is refused if any differs.
- The command runs at most once: the runner takes run.lock, records the job as running, and
  removes its launchd agent afterwards. launchd fires a missed time on wake; a run later than
  the grace period is recorded as missed and does not run.
- A one-shot job always ends: the command runs in its own process group for at most
  timeout_minutes (10 when the command file gives none); its output is kept as bytes, whatever
  it printed; an error in the runner records the job as failed. A job left "running" by a
  runner that died is settled with cancel or resolve.
- Job folders are 0700 and the files written in them 0600 (copies 0400).

What a recurring job (--every) adds:
- Every firing re-verifies the copies, the program and the runner; a mismatch records the
  firing as refused, marks the job refused and unloads it, so it stops firing.
- A firing while the previous one still runs records skipped-overlap and exits: run.lock in
  the job folder holds an flock and the holder's PID; the kernel drops the flock when the
  holder dies, so a lock left by a dead runner is stale and taken over.
- Each firing appends one line to runs.jsonl (started_at, ended_at, status, exit code,
  stdout and stderr tails of at most 4 kB each).
- The command runs in its own process group; past timeout_minutes the group is killed and
  the firing recorded as failed with reason timeout.

verbs:
  schedule  Run the command in --command-file once at --at, or every --every
            minutes (5 to 1440). Run it first with --dry-run: it prints the job
            and its "approved" digest. After the calling skill's gate, run it
            again with --confirmed --approved <digest>; it refuses when anything
            changed since the dry run.
  list      Print every job with its status (scheduled, running, done, failed,
            refused, missed, cancelled). A recurring job also shows every_minutes
            and last_run (its last firing: done, failed, refused, skipped-overlap).
  cancel    Unload a scheduled job, one-shot or recurring; needs --confirmed.
            A one-shot job caught while running is stopped and recorded as
            cancelled with "interrupted": its command may have acted.
  resolve   Settle a one-shot job left "running" by a runner that is gone (a
            crash, a power loss), after checking what its command did: --done
            or --failed, and --confirmed (or --dry-run). Refused while the
            runner still holds the job's lock.
  run       Internal: what launchd calls at the set time or at each interval.

command file (JSON):
  {
    "argv": ["uv", "run", "/abs/providers/publisher/linkedin.py", "publish", ...],
    "cwd": "/absolute/working/directory",
    "snapshot": ["/abs/providers/publisher/linkedin.py", "/abs/post.txt"],
    "outputs": ["/abs/result.json"],
    "grace_minutes": 120
  }
  With --at, "grace_minutes" (default 120, 0 to 10080: a week) is how late the
  run may start; a later firing is recorded as missed and runs nothing.
  With --every, "grace_minutes" is refused and "timeout_minutes" (default 30,
  1 to 240) bounds each firing: past it the command's process group is killed
  and the firing is recorded as failed with reason timeout.
  With --at, "timeout_minutes" is optional (default 10, 1 to 240) and bounds the
  one run the same way: past it the command's whole process group is killed,
  the job is recorded as failed with reason timeout, and what the command had
  printed is kept in run.stdout.log and run.stderr.log. Give a command that
  needs longer its own timeout_minutes; it is part of the approved digest.
  "snapshot" is required. Every argv entry after argv[0] that names an existing
  file, bare or as --flag=<path>, absolute or relative to cwd, must be listed in
  it (as an absolute path) and is replaced by the job's copy of that file; a file
  argument left out makes the job refused, and so does a file named in another
  spelling (-f<path>, key=<path>, a list joined by ',', ':' or ';'), which the
  scheduler cannot swap for a copy. "outputs" (optional) lists absolute
  paths the command writes and does not read; they are exempt. argv[0] is resolved to an absolute
  path at schedule time and hashed. Directories are not snapshotted: files the
  command reads from cwd or from a directory argument are not verified.

environment variables:
  SCHEDULER_HOME        job folders. Default: ~/Library/Application Support/ai-workbench/scheduler
  SCHEDULER_AGENTS_DIR  where plists go. Default: ~/Library/LaunchAgents
  SCHEDULER_TEST        1 enables test mode; required for SCHEDULER_LAUNCHCTL.
  SCHEDULER_LAUNCHCTL   tests only (with SCHEDULER_TEST=1): replaces /bin/launchctl.
  SCHEDULER_NOTIFY      0 disables the macOS notification after a run.

output: JSON on stdout; diagnostics on stderr.
exit codes: 0 success, 1 provider error, 2 usage error, 3 not configured.

The computer must be on, awake and logged in at the set time (a user agent runs in the
login session). A time missed while asleep runs on wake, within the grace period.
A recurring job's first firing comes one interval after loading; per launchd.plist(5), an
interval firing due while the Mac sleeps, or while the previous firing runs, is missed.
