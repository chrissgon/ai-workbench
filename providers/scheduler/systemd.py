"""Scheduler provider for Linux: run a command through systemd user units, once at a set time or every N minutes.

The same interface and guarantees as launchd.py, on a systemd user manager (a small always-on
server is the case it was written for). A job approved here means what it means under launchd:
the approval digest is computed from the same fields, the same way.

Sources: the systemd manual pages, accessed 2026-09-30. freedesktop.org answered with a bot check,
so the text was read from the pages' source in the systemd repository (man/*.xml and
src/core/timer.c at commit 889bc48f101a7cbb56cb4be202e85e1f6d933151, 2026-09-29):
- systemd.timer(5) https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.timer.html
  OnCalendar= is a wall-clock timer. Persistent=true stores the last trigger time on disk and, when
  the timer is activated, triggers the service at once if it would have triggered while the timer
  was inactive (only with OnCalendar=). A calendar timer that elapses during suspend is acted on at
  resume. OnActiveSec= is relative to the timer's activation, OnUnitActiveSec= to the last
  activation of the unit it starts. OnBootSec= in the past elapses at once when the timer is
  activated; the other monotonic directives do not. AccuracySec= defaults to 1min. "In case the
  unit to activate is already active at the time the timer elapses it is not restarted, but simply
  left running." Unit= defaults to the service of the same name. Default dependencies add
  Before=timers.target.
- systemd.time(7) https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.time.html
  a calendar event "2003-03-05 05:40 UTC" names one point in time (year included); "min" is a time
  span unit; a repetition such as *:0/N restarts every hour.
- systemd.service(5) https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.service.html
  Type=oneshot stays "activating" until the program exits, then returns to inactive, so another
  start runs it again; TimeoutStartSec= is disabled by default for oneshot. ExecStart= items are
  unquoted per systemd.syntax(7); % specifiers apply (%% is a literal %); $$ is a literal $.
- systemd.exec(5) https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html
  Environment= (quoted assignments, no $ expansion, specifiers expanded), UMask=,
  StandardOutput=append:path.
- systemd.kill(5) https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.kill.html
  KillMode=control-group (the default) kills every process left in the unit's control group on stop.
- systemd.unit(5) https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.unit.html
  user units are read from $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/systemd/user, or ~/.config/systemd/user.
- systemd.special(7) https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.special.html
  timer units installed by applications use WantedBy=timers.target.
- systemctl(1) https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemctl.html
  --user, daemon-reload, enable --now (enable and start), disable --now (disable and stop), stop,
  list-timers, clean --what=state (removes a Persistent= timer's timestamp; the unit must be stopped).
- loginctl(1) https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/loginctl.html
  enable-linger: "a user manager is spawned for the user at boot and kept around after logouts";
  show-user USER --property=Linger --value prints the property's value.

What a job guarantees (as in launchd.py):
- Every file the command reads through its arguments is in the command file's "snapshot" and
  is copied into the job folder with its SHA-256; the arguments are swapped for the copies. A file
  argument left out of the snapshot makes the job refused, and so does a file
  named in another spelling (-f<path>, key=<path>, a list of paths).
- The program (argv[0]) and this runner are hashed; the service runs the runner's copy.
- The dry run prints the approval digest; the confirmed call must pass it back. Every firing
  hashes the copies, the program and the runner again and refuses on any difference.
- A one-shot job runs at most once (run.lock) and a firing later than grace_minutes is recorded as missed.
  It always ends: its command runs in its own process group for at most timeout_minutes (10 when the
  command file gives none), its output is kept as bytes, and an error in the runner records the job as
  failed. A job left "running" by a runner that died is settled with cancel or resolve.
- A recurring job never overlaps (run.lock: flock plus the holder's PID), bounds each firing with
  timeout_minutes by killing the command's process group, and appends to runs.jsonl.
- Job folders are 0700, files 0600, copies 0400; the unit files are 0600.

systemd mapping (why: providers/scheduler/README.md, "Linux systemd"):
- dev.ai-workbench.scheduler.<id>.service: Type=oneshot, ExecStart runs the runner copy with python3.
- dev.ai-workbench.scheduler.<id>.timer: a one-shot job has OnCalendar=<UTC time> with
  Persistent=true; a recurring job has OnActiveSec=<N>min and OnUnitActiveSec=<N>min. Both set
  AccuracySec=1s and WantedBy=timers.target.

verbs:
  schedule  Run the command in --command-file once at --at, or every --every
            minutes (5 to 1440). Run it first with --dry-run: it prints the job,
            the unit files and its "approved" digest. After the calling skill's
            gate, run it again with --confirmed --approved <digest>; it refuses
            when anything changed since the dry run.
  list      Print every job with its status (scheduled, running, done, failed,
            refused, missed, cancelled). A recurring job also shows every_minutes
            and last_run (its last firing: done, failed, refused, skipped-overlap).
  cancel    Stop and remove a scheduled job's timer and service; needs --confirmed.
            A one-shot job caught while running is stopped and recorded as
            cancelled with "interrupted": its command may have acted.
  resolve   Settle a one-shot job left "running" by a runner that is gone (a
            crash, a power loss), after checking what its command did: --done
            or --failed, and --confirmed (or --dry-run). Refused while the
            runner still holds the job's lock.
  run       Internal: what the service runs at the set time or at each interval.

command file (JSON): the same as launchd.py's.
  {
    "argv": ["uv", "run", "/abs/providers/publisher/linkedin.py", "publish", ...],
    "cwd": "/absolute/working/directory",
    "snapshot": ["/abs/providers/publisher/linkedin.py", "/abs/post.txt"],
    "outputs": ["/abs/result.json"],
    "grace_minutes": 120
  }
  With --at, "grace_minutes" (default 120, 0 to 10080: a week) is how late the
  run may start; a later firing is recorded as missed and runs nothing.
  With --every, "grace_minutes" is refused and "timeout_minutes" (default 30,
  1 to 240) bounds each firing. With --at, "timeout_minutes" is optional
  (default 10, 1 to 240) and bounds the one run the same way: past it the
  command's whole process group is killed, the job is recorded as failed with
  reason timeout, and what the command had printed is kept in run.stdout.log
  and run.stderr.log. Every argv entry after argv[0] that names an
  existing file, bare or as --flag=<path>, must be in "snapshot" and is replaced
  by the job's copy; "outputs" lists paths the command only writes.

environment variables:
  SCHEDULER_HOME        job folders. Default: $XDG_DATA_HOME/ai-workbench/scheduler,
                        or ~/.local/share/ai-workbench/scheduler
  SCHEDULER_UNITS_DIR   where the unit files go. Default: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/systemd/user,
                        or ~/.config/systemd/user
  SCHEDULER_TEST        1 enables test mode; required for the two overrides below.
  SCHEDULER_SYSTEMCTL   tests only (with SCHEDULER_TEST=1): replaces systemctl.
  SCHEDULER_LOGINCTL    tests only (with SCHEDULER_TEST=1): replaces loginctl.
  SCHEDULER_NOTIFY      0 disables the outcome lines in <SCHEDULER_HOME>/notifications.jsonl.

output: JSON on stdout; diagnostics on stderr.
exit codes: 0 success, 1 provider error, 2 usage error, 3 not configured (--check: no
user manager, or lingering off, so timers would stop at logout).

The user's service manager must run while nobody is logged in: loginctl enable-linger <user>
(it needs the polkit action org.freedesktop.login1.set-user-linger, usually granted to root).
