"""The executor: where an eval's commands run. Every model run, grading, case setup and fixture commit
executes in a container built from evals/container/, one container per command (docs/decisions.md,
2026-10-01: one environment, no host mode).

What a container sees:
  /eval               the run's folder (case/, out/, prompt.md), read-write: the only thing a run can change.
                      The runner staged in case/ the copies of the skills this run is given, before the
                      container started (evals/eval_run.py, scripts/stage_skills.py)
  /wb/run-prompt.sh   the one adapter script the command starts, read-only (model runs and gradings only)
Nothing else of the machine or of the workbench: no adapters folder, no skill folder, no shared folder, no
home folder, no other checkout, no credential store.

Network, per command:
  none    no network at all (setup commands, the fixture commit)
  proxy   an internal network whose only way out is a proxy that lets through the hosts listed in
          evals/container/proxy/allow.txt, the model providers (model runs and gradings)
  open    the default network (a case with "allow_web": true); a run whose key a key proxy holds is put
          on that proxy's open network instead, one of the eval's own, where the proxy also listens

Secrets reach a container as environment variables named by the caller; their values travel in the
environment of the docker client, never on a command line. A variable passed that way can be read by
every command the model runs: that is why the runner replaces the passed values in everything a run
leaves (evals/eval_run.py, "Secrets in what a run leaves"). Each tier's credential is kept out of its
runs instead, by a key proxy of its own (evals/container/keyproxy/: keyproxy.json names the floor model's
provider key, keyproxy-strong.json the strong model's credential). When a command is passed one of those
variables, the run container gets a placeholder in it and its proxy's base URL in the route's
"base_url_env"; that key proxy, a container of its own on its tier's internal network and on its tier's
open network, holds the value, forwards the provider's API path only, to the provider's one host, over
HTTPS and through the egress proxy, and adds the key to each call. The runner starts it (keyproxy())
before such a command. Each tier's proxy is on networks of its own: a run can still spend its own tier's
key, through its proxy, on the provider's API, but it can no longer read it, print it or take it
elsewhere, and it cannot reach the other tier's proxy. The proxy filters by host name only, and the
hosts it lets through serve many accounts: a run reaches no other host, but could still hand data to
another account of the same provider. The proxy is not a guarantee that nothing leaves.

Environment. The clock (TZ=UTC), the locale, the user name and the git identity of a run are the
image's own: nothing of the caller's machine sets them. From the caller come only the two variables
that keep git inside the case folder (FORWARD) and the variables the caller names.

Privileges. A run container starts with every capability dropped, with no way to gain a privilege
(no-new-privileges) and with a limit on the number of processes (PIDS_LIMIT).

The image. Its definition is pinned (base images by digest, a dated package index, a lock file for
the two runners), and it is built for one CPU platform, IMAGE_PLATFORM: lab evidence is made on that
platform only. WB_EVAL_IMAGE_PLATFORM builds and runs another one (the CI job, which tests the
definition on its own architecture); `ensure` then says so in "image_platform", and the runner
writes no evidence from such an environment. The images, the networks and the proxies are named after
a hash of evals/container/ (the hash of the definition's text, not of an image: two builds of one
definition can differ, which is why a built image is kept as an archive), so a change to the
definition builds new ones.

Usage (the runner imports this module; the commands are for a person):
  python3 evals/executor.py ensure     build what is missing, start the proxy, print the environment
  python3 evals/executor.py clean      remove the proxies and the networks of the current definition
  python3 evals/executor.py archive --out <file.tar>
                                       save the built image as an archive, to be kept: prints its
                                       sha256, the image's digest and its platform as JSON
