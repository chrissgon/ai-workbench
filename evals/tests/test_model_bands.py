"""Offline tests of the band, the cause and the gate of every model (the reliability model, section 10): each model
that has evidence of a skill gets the figures the reference model gets, by the same rules on its own lines, and
only the reference model's band decides the skill's standing. No model is called: evidence is written here, with
the helpers of test_bands.py.
