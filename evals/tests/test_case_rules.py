"""The rules for cases of evals/README.md that need no model and no runner: the form of an assertion and
its tags, and one guard per declared side effect.

`assertion_problems` and `effects_without_a_guard` are the reference of those two rules. The first is
applied here to every case file of the repository. The second is only tested: three skills have no guard
for a declared effect until their own change adds the case, so the validator applies it as a warning first
(item B14 of docs/architecture/final-plan-2026-10-02.md, which also makes the preflight accept the tags).
