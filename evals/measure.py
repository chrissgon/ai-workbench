"""What decides what a run measures, in one module (item B10 of docs/architecture/final-plan-2026-10-02.md).

The eval runner (evals/eval_run.py) and the status script (evals/eval_status.py) import it; it imports
neither. It holds:

  - the facts block the grader is given (facts_block), the commands that read the case's repository for it
    (VCS_SCRIPT) and the length they are cut at (VCS_LIMIT);
  - what the grader is shown of a file a run produced (shown, binary_stub, NOT_SHOWN, FILE_LIMIT);
  - the grading prompt (assertion_text, grading_prompt) and the reading of the grader's answer
    (read_grading, which refuses a verdict that disagrees with what its own evidence concludes: conclusion),
    with the number of times a refused answer is asked for again (GRADING_RETRIES);
  - which failed verdicts of a with-skill run are graded once more, and which of them the second grading
    confirms (guard_positions, failed_guards, confirmed_guards);
  - the early-end rule (early_end), which decides which runs are made again instead of scored;
  - the replacement of the passed variables' values by a marker (redaction_values, replace_values);
  - the scoring of a run (score, grading_summary) and the unrounded comparisons of the gate (at_threshold,
    within_tolerance, gate_passes).

The constants that no other file owns (the file limit, the early-end phrase lists and the others above) are
data in evals/measurement.json, read once when the module loads. The number of runs, the timeout and the
retries of an event have their home in the gate file (evals/eval-gate.json); what an adapter's harness prints
on a refusal or an exhausted account, in that adapter's adapter.json.

This file and evals/measurement.json are in the measurement fingerprint (eval_status.py, FINGERPRINT_FILES):
a change to either is committed as one of the three kinds of the reliability model's section 8
(`python3 evals/eval_status.py measurement --kind grader|execution|infrastructure`). The rest of the runner
(arguments, concurrency, the shared lock, resuming, the reports) is infrastructure and may change freely.

Standard library only. It has no command line of its own: `--help` prints this text.
