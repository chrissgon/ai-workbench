"""The standing of every skill, computed from its evidence: the pessimistic score and the band (the reliability

The records of the first round, skills/<name>/evals/result.json, are history (the reliability model, section 1):
nothing writes one any more, nothing reads one, and no evidence is converted from them.

Content hash: sha256 over the files of the skill folder (sorted relative paths and their bytes), leaving out
all of evals/ (the cases, the evidence, the version file, the old record), everything under scripts/tests/,
caches (__pycache__, .pytest_cache, *.pyc, .DS_Store) and the marker file an installer writes into a copied
skill folder (.installed-by-ai-workbench). A change to SKILL.md, a reference, an asset or a script changes it;
a case, an evidence file, a test and files outside the folder do not: none of them is read by a model that
uses the skill, and none is copied into an eval run. Each case has a hash of its own (`hash --skill <name>`
prints both): over the whole case object as it stands in the case file and the bytes of its fixture files,
with "workbench_files" as the list of paths, never as the content of those files.

Evidence. The eval runner writes one file per test event, skills/<name>/evals/evidence/lab-<test id>.jsonl
(the reliability model, section 1): a first line that describes the event and one line per run. Both have
closed keys: `evidence` below validates every file, and an unknown key or a value outside its form is an
error. A committed evidence file is written by tooling and never edited. The old records, result.json, stay
as the history of the first round, and nothing reads them.

  The event line: {"record": "test", "skill", "test", "kind": "full"|"partial", "version", "content_sha256",
   "date", "models": {tier: model id}, "adapters": {tier: adapter}, "adapter_sha256": {adapter: sha256 of its
   run-prompt.sh}, "grader", "runs", "timeout_seconds", "retries", "measurement_version",
   "measurement_sha256", "image_digest", "image_platform", "grading_template_sha256", "tools": {name:
   version}, "cases": {case id: case hash}, "baseline": {case id: "run"|"reused"|"none"}, "web_cases": [ids],
   "counts": {model id: {"with"|"without": {"retries", "refusals", "timeouts", "pauses", "early_ends",
   "resumes"[, "invoked"]}}}, "extra_pass_env": [names], "complete": bool[, "gate": {"passed", "with",
   "baseline", "threshold", "tolerance"[, "note"]}][, "upstream": {model id: provider}]}
  A run line: {"record": "run", "skill", "version", "content_sha256", "model", "adapter", "kind", "test",
   "date", "measurement_version", "measurement_sha256", "case", "case_sha256", "variant": "with"|"without",
   "outcome": "graded"|"timeout", "score", "results": [0|1, ...][, "context_sha256"][, "platform"]
   [, "guard_failed": [positions]]}

A run line with "platform" is a run of a case of that platform's case file, skills/<name>/evals/platforms/
<platform>.json (eval_run.py --platform; the plan's decision 14c): it belongs to a partial test and to a run
with the skill. Such lines never enter the gate or a score: `status` shows, per platform and model, their mean
and their number of runs ("platforms" in a skill's row), counting the lines whose case is still in that file
with the same hash, at or above the measurement floor, of the current major version.

A model id in a line is an id of the gate file's "models" ({id: [aliases]}): an alias is written as its id,
anything else as "unknown", so that one model never falls into two rows and a private model name never enters
the repository. Without that key the known ids are the configured strong model, floor model and grader.

The eval gate is configured in evals/eval-gate.json, committed: {"strong_model", "strong_harness",
"floor_model", "floor_harness", "floor_pass_env": [variables], "strong_pass_env": [variables], "grader",
"threshold", "strong_tolerance", "measurement_version", "measurement_floor"}, once a measurement version is
closed "measurement_sha256", the optional "models" ({model id: [aliases]}, the ids an evidence line may
carry) and the optional keys that control a test event (below). It names the models, the adapters and the grader a test uses (eval_run.py takes
them as defaults) and what the gate and the bands are computed against. "measurement_version" is a number raised when a change alters what a run measures (the
`measurement` command below says how, by kind). The file sits outside skills/, so changing it changes no
content hash; the status reacts instead. Without the file there is no model list, no threshold of its own
(0.8 and a tolerance of 0 are taken) and no floor (1).

"measurement_floor" is the version below which lab evidence weighs nothing (the reliability model, section 8):
a whole number from 1 to the measurement version. "measurement_sha256" is the fingerprint of the files that
decide what a run measures, 64 hexadecimal characters. A gate file without it describes a measurement version
that is still open: files that decide what a run measures are still changing under that number, so nothing
measured meanwhile is written as evidence (evidence_refusal below; the runner asks it).

Control of a test event, all optional keys of the gate file (a key it lacks takes the default in brackets):
"runs" [3], the runs of every case; "timeout_seconds" [900], the limit of one model run; "retries" [2], how
often a run that timed out, was refused, failed in its adapter or ended early is made again inside the event;
"max_resumes" [3], how often `eval_run.py --resume` reruns one failed run before it is written as a timeout
with score 0; "total_jobs" [10], the model runs in progress at one time over every runner process of the
machine; "web_jobs" [{"strong": 2, "floor": 2}], the same for runs on the open network, per tier;
"web_cases", {skill: [case ids]}, the only cases that may set "allow_web" (with a gate file and no such key,
none may); "strong_web_pass_env", the variables a strong-model run of a web case receives in place of
"strong_pass_env" (a low-limit API key in place of the account's token). An event made with another number of
runs, another timeout or another number of retries than these writes no evidence (eval_run.py --help), and
an evidence file whose event line carries another "runs" than the configured one is not valid (`evidence`).

Field evidence (the reliability model, section 7) is a use of a skill in a project, recorded there by
scripts/evidence.py and contributed as skills/<name>/evals/evidence/field-<id>.jsonl, <id> being the first 12
characters of the file's sha256. Its lines have closed keys and no free text:
  {"record": "use"|"verdict", "skill", "version", "content_sha256", "model" (a listed id or "unknown"), "adapter"
   (an adapter's folder name or "unknown"), "use" (8 hex), "week" (YYYY-Www)[, "score": 1|0.5|0 and "judge":
   "user"|"check", for a verdict]}
Every line carries the content hash the skill's version file gives for its version. `evidence` validates these
files too.

The score and the band of a skill (the reliability model, sections 4 to 6). A with-skill lab line of a case of
evals/evals.json weighs above zero when its case exists with the same hash, its measurement version is at or
above the floor and its major version is the current one (nothing is carried across a major version). On one
model, the current set holds the lines of the current X.Y with the current context hash, graded by the
configured grader and dated after the newest epoch that reaches the skill; each counts as one run. Everything
else that weighs is inherited (an earlier X.Y; the current X.Y before an epoch or with another context; an
earlier grader; on the reference model, the earlier reference model's lines) and counts, all together, as at
most 3 runs: each line weighs min(1, 3 / their number). With S the weighted sum of scores, N the weighted
number of runs, p = S / N and z = 1.2816, the pessimistic score is the lower bound of the Wilson interval,
(p + z^2/2N - z sqrt(p(1-p)/N + z^2/4N^2)) / (1 + z^2/N), 0 when N is 0: a penalty for little evidence, never a
confidence bound, always printed with the mean and N.

The band, on the reference model (strong_model), the first that applies:
  needs a test  (a) no full test of the current major version passes the gate (none at or above the
                measurement floor, or the gate cannot be computed); (b) a guard assertion (tagged guard or
                guard:<effect>) has no with-skill run in the current set, or a confirmed failure there
                ("guard_failed"); (c) the newest full test fails the gate, or a case changed after it
  watch         no with-skill lab line in the current set; or the current set holds runs of guard-only cases
                alone; or the pessimistic score is under 0.70; or three or more Y changes (the version file)
                since the version the newest complete full test ran on; or the field signal is on
  reliable      otherwise
The field signal: three or more `failed` verdicts on the current X.Y, on the reference model, in the weeks after
the newest lab event of that X.Y (all of them when it has none), at most one per contributor except the
repository's owner. The contributor of a field file is the author of the commit that added it, read from git
and stored nowhere; the owner is the author of the commits that added lab evidence. One contributor adds at
most 20 uses and 20 verdicts to the field columns of one skill. Field evidence never raises a band. Without git
history the field columns are not computed and the signal is off.

Commands:
  status     prints {"skills": [row], "counts": {band: n}, "causes": {kind: n}, "gate": {the configured gate}}.
             A row: {"skill", "version", "band", "cause", "kind", "command" (what clears it), "causes": [{"kind",
             "cause", "command"}], "pending": [case ids added and not run yet; "pending_command"], "score",
             "mean", "runs" (N), "current_runs", "inherited_runs", "gate", "last_full_test", "guards": [{"case",
             "assertion", "state": "passed"|"failed"|"not run"}], "field": {"computed", "signal", "on"},
             "models": {model id: {"score", "mean", "runs", "current_runs", "inherited_runs"[, "field": {"uses",
             "judged", "mean"}][, "platforms": {platform: {"mean", "runs"}}]}}[, "assertions": [{"case",
             "assertion", "tags", "with": [passes, runs], "without": [passes, runs]}], "difference_not_format"]}.
             The kinds of a cause: "no passing full test", "guard", "gate failed" (needs a test); "no current run",
             "guard cases only", "score", "y changes", "field signal" (watch). Exit 0.
  hash       prints the content hash of one skill, its version and the hash of each of its cases (and of each case of
             its platforms' case files, "platform_cases").
  evidence   validates the evidence files: every skill's, one skill's (--skill) or one file (--file <path>,
             which may be in a run folder's scratch tree). Prints {"files", "problems": {path: [...]}};
             exit 1 when a file is not valid.
  gate       prints the gate of one skill computed from its lab evidence (the model's section 2, below):
             {"computed", "passed", "with", "baseline", "threshold", "tolerance", "version", "test", "cases",
             "pending", "note", "cause"}.
  inventory  writes the two snapshot tables of the reliability model's section 10 between <!-- eval-status:begin -->
             and <!-- eval-status:end --> in docs/inventory.md (--write): the band table, one row per skill on the
             reference model, and the model table, one row per skill and model that has any evidence, marked with
             the commit they were generated at. --check exits 1 when the tables differ from what would be generated
             now, the commit line aside. They are a published snapshot: no pull request has to regenerate them, and
             the validator reports tables behind the evidence as a warning, never as an error.
  measurement  commits a change of a file the measurement fingerprint covers as one of the three kinds of the
             reliability model's section 8, and rewrites the gate file: --kind grader raises the measurement
             version and the floor; --kind execution raises the version and appends an epoch dated --date (today,
             UTC, by default) for the skills of --skills and the models of --models ("all" by default, the listed
             ids otherwise; a hosted model that changed under its id is entered this way, with --models <its id>);
             --kind infrastructure writes the new fingerprint alone, and refuses when it is unchanged. Each writes
             the fingerprint this checkout computes. No kind multiplies old evidence by a factor. --close writes the
             fingerprint of a measurement version that is still open, which closes it; a --kind change needs a
             closed version. Prints {"kind", "measurement_version", "measurement_floor", "measurement_sha256",
             "epoch", "decisions_entry"}: the entry is added to docs/decisions.md in the same commit.

  bump       raises a skill's metadata.version by one step of the class of its change (the reliability model's
             section 3): x, y or z raises that part of the version of the pull request's base (comparison_base:
             WB_BASE_REF, else the merge base with the default branch) and resets the lower parts, writes it into
             SKILL.md and appends one line to skills/<name>/evals/versions.jsonl: {"version", "content_sha256",
             "class", "date"[, "z_chars"]}, z_chars being the characters a Z change counts. Idempotent: run again,
             or with a higher class after more edits, it rewrites the one line this pull request adds. With no
             class it writes the first line of a skill that has none in the base, with the version of its
             frontmatter (X.Y.Z) and the hash of its content as it then is, class "new": run it again after the
             last edit. Prints the line.
  migrate-versions  writes the version file of every skill that has none: one line, the version read as X.Y.Z
             (a two-part 0.N is 0.N.0), the current content hash, class "new". It edits no SKILL.md.

The version rules the validator applies (scripts/validate.py, against the same base; version_findings): the
content hash equals the hash of the version file's last line, and metadata.version is X.Y.Z and that line's
version (a warning until the sweep that closes phase C, an error from it); the file is append-only, with at
most one line added; the class of the added line agrees with the diff (change_class): X for a difference in
side_effects, an item removed from outputs or updates, a changed line of the Confirmation gate or Stop rules
section or of the external-content line; Z only for lines of SKILL.md in Purpose or before the first heading
that change no number, path, code span or listed word, within 300 characters since the newest lab evidence;
Y for the rest. A declared X is never refused. Without a base (a skill built in a case folder) the last two
are skipped.

The measurement fingerprint: sha256 over the files of FINGERPRINT_FILES (the grading template, the measuring
module evals/measure.py and its constants evals/measurement.json, the executor, the staging module), every file
of evals/container/, and the run-prompt.sh and adapter.json of each eval adapter. scripts/validate.py fails when
it differs from a committed "measurement_sha256"; the runner computes it when an event starts, writes it into
every evidence line and writes no evidence when it differs.

The gate (the reliability model, section 2). Only a full test evaluates it, and the runner writes its result
into the event line when the test ends; `gate` computes it again from the lines. It is computed over the run
lines with the skill, of kind full, on the reference model (strong_model), of the X.Y version the newest full
test ran on and of the same epoch as that test, every current case being required and only lines of weight
above zero being counted: the case exists with the same hash, the measurement version is at or above the
floor, and the line's major version is the current one. A second full test of an unchanged X.Y adds its runs
to the first and replaces none; a full test closed as abandoned keeps its lines. The mean of those lines
passes when it is at the threshold or above and is not below the mean of the baselines in force by more than
the tolerance, both unrounded. A partial test never moves the gate, with one exception: a case added after
the newest full test is "pending", and is left out of the gate, until it has with-skill lines and a baseline
in force (eval_run.py --cases <id> --baseline); those lines then enter the gate. A case changed after the
newest full test makes the gate impossible to compute until a full test runs it. When a case of the gate has
no baseline in force (after an epoch that reaches the skill), the result the newest full test wrote stands,
with the note "baseline expired".
A baseline line is in force while three things are unchanged: the case (its hash), the reference model (no
epoch of it after the line's date: "epochs" of the gate file, [{"date", "models", "skills", "cause"}], where
models and skills are lists or "all"), and the measurement (its version at or above the floor). The skill's
version does not age it: a run without the skill never saw the skill.

Data goes to stdout as JSON, diagnostics to stderr. Standard library only.
Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 the snapshot tables are behind (--check) or an evidence file is not valid, 2 usage error.
A band never makes a command fail.
